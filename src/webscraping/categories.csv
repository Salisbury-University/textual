tech,"Technology is the most useful form of science for the general population. In simple words, technology is
 when we take the concepts of science and transform them into gadgets and devices that are useful to us 
as human beings. When we look around us, almost everything is a result of or a form of technology.

For example, the device you are using right now is a form of technology made for communication, or 
the refrigerator in your kitchen is a use of science that helps to keep your food fresh and cool. With 
these examples, we see how dependent we are on technology and how important it is for us in our daily lives.

It isn’t easy to imagine our lives without using any form of technology. For the smallest of communications,
 we tend to turn to our mobile phones. Even most of the food we eat is packaged in factories using various 
technologies. Thus, imagining a life without technology is impossible. It is not only a fact of life but 
also a necessity for all of us.

In fact, the smartphone, that is, a mobile phone which can connect to the internet, is becoming one of the 
fastest-growing and most accessible forms of technology around the world. On a smartphone, you can click 
photographs, browse the internet, listen to music, and use social media. With the advent of smartphone 
technology, the practical purpose of not only communicating with your friends is met, but also so many 
others, as mentioned.

hist,"

The most interesting fact about the extent and comprehensiveness of history is that today we hear of 
“History of Art,” “History of Culture,” History of Civilization,” “History of Religion,” “History of Music,”
 “History of Geography,””History of Physics,” “History of Philosophy,” “History of Education,” “History of 
Biology,” “History of the Atom,” “History of Literature,” “History of Mathematics,” and History of what not.

A learned speaker on a political, religious, literary or any other platform connected with any field of 
human activity, will place before his audience pure and simple history, connected with the life and 
achievements of some past of great human beings and nothing else. This makes the scope of history almost 
limitless, which knows no ends and also speaks of the importance of history as a teaching subject in 
schools and colleges.

Thus, history has expanded both vertically and horizontally. Its close connection with the allied fields 
of human sciences, has given new effects to historical studies.

In the words of Lord Action, “If the past has been an obstacle and a burden, a knowledge of past is the
 safest and surest emancipation”.

In the words of E. Lewis Hasluck, “knowledge of history illumines the whole of human life. It adds to our 
knowledge of the existing state of world, a knowledge in which the human society and institution has grown 
up, a knowledge for future.”

From the above discussion at becomes clear that the subject of history has no frontiers and that it is
 limitless and fathomless ocean, with no ends in view. However for instructional purposes in schools
 and colleges, we have to limit its scope and frontiers.

Religion is referred to as a system of beliefs, practices, and values con­cerned with the sacred. 
It is related to supernatural entities and powers which are considered as the ultimate concern of 
all mundane existence among human groups. Sociologists are not concerned with the competing claims 
of different religions.

They mainly deal with the social effects of religious beliefs and practices. In other words, 
the sociological analysis of religion is concerned with how religious beliefs and practices are 
articulated in society, how they affect interaction among persons of different religious faiths, 
how they lead to conflicts and riots (communalism), and how secularism, can contain interreligious biases.

The following are the kinds of questions addressed by sociologists of religion: How does religion 
reinforce the collective unity or social solidarity of a group through religious worship and rituals?
 How does religion block the emotional and intellectual development of people? (Marx). How is a particular
 type of economic system (say, capitalism) the product of a specific religious ideology (say Protestantism)?

Advertising is a social and business process responsible for the mass communication of the information. 
Today, advertising is the fastest growing industry in the world that has come to stay so long as the 
forces of competition are at constant work deciding the destinies of the firms.

The size of the industry can be measured in terms of the amount spent on this creative activity of education 
and entertainment. In India, the growth of industry has been phenomenal.

In 1971, the amount spent was Rs. 650 million. In 1980, it jumped to Rs. 4,000 million and in 1986 it 
reached a height of Rs. 5,000 million. The current rate of growth is 15 per cent annually and is expected 
to spend Rs. 7,000 million in 1990s. With all this the expenditure incurred so far is less than 0.1 percent 
of the gross national product as against 2.5 per cent in the U.S.A. 2 per cent in Sweden, 1.75 per cent in the U.K. 
and 0.1 per cent in Japan.

"
sci,"

Science is the investigation of any marvel or thing that can be watched and recorded. The information about 
that thing or marvel can be sorted out efficiently in predefined rules. Science is wherever around us. We have 
just barely started to comprehend the laws and the rules that oversee the working of our general surroundings
 in a manner that can be clarified in normal terms.

Everything that can be clarified intelligently can be called science. In the old occasions since science was 
seen as clarifying a ton of occasions that were viewed as wonders of God, Christianity was against it. It shut
down convictions, for example, human development, the earth being the focal point of the universe and so on.
Today the life of solaces and facilitate that we live all gratitude to science.


Science gets rationale and reasonability to all that occurs around us. As opposed to living in a condition of 
forecasts and expectation, we can be genuinely sure about how the morrow will spread out. Clinical Science has 
helped us comprehend the working of the human body. This has empowered the clinical investigations that find 
medicines making headways on personal satisfaction.

The modern world is totally founded on the standards of science. Present-day transport also is an endowment of 
science whether it is on water, land or air; and these are turning out to be increasingly more progressed with 
the death of years.

Building science has brought to us structures that are utilizing better assets and making them more secure, 
particularly in regions inclined to quakes, floods, volcanoes and so on. Data Technology as a science is 
making the trade of data simple and productive, thanks to web and PCs. Veterinary science is helping creatures 
in having a superior life. They can be dealt with, relieved and given a superior sickness free life.

cul,"

According to UNESCO, “We speak of culture in connection with the behaviour of people, the moral values and 
human relations. We denote it by action, behaviour and attitudes considered useful for the interests of 
society or of a certain social group. We mean standard of living, of habitation and clothing, of physical 
culture.

We appraise by it the culture of language, of thought, of work.” Social anthropologists distinguish between
 ‘material’ and ‘non-material’ culture.

The former includes technology, art forms, architecture, material goods and equipments used in daily life, 
that is, in household, agriculture, trade and commerce, warfare and other ‘social’ activities. In the latter 
are included the literary and intellectual traditions, beliefs, myths, legends and other forms of oral tradition.

In a broad sense, then, culture is that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, 
custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by a human being as a member of society. The basic 
elements of culture are values, norms, symbols (e.g., language), folklore and religious ideas.

Culture has three dimensions. First, it is a normative system, by which we mean that there is social control 
in the form of sanctions, which make people follow generally accepted moral/ethical norms. Secondly, there is 
the expressive system; music, dance, art, literature and so on are cultural expressions of the people.

Thirdly, it is a system of ideas which enables members of a society to interpret the world meaningfully. And 
the process through which culture Influences a Social System Is Called Institutionalisation.

Great lengths of mountains, thriving ecosystems, the ever-spreading sky together with the lithosphere, 
hydrosphere and atmosphere create a saga called “Nature”. Rich both in terms of its scenic beauty and 
replenishing resources, nature accounts for supporting life in different shapes and forms on our planet.

Every member of the living world obtains its life support from nature. Nature guides the cycling of air, 
water and life between the different constituents or spheres on Earth. The treasures in nature not only 
provide for our basic requirements of survival but also fuel the raw materials to support factories and 
industries on which the modern world primarily runs.

Since the population is increasing at an exponential rate largely in India and many parts of the world, 
the “use” of resources has now turned to depletion. Adding to this, are the excessive levels of atmospheric 
and environmental pollution. Industrial wastes, unchecked use of vehicles, illegal cutting of trees, poaching 
of animals, nuclear power plants and many more are contributing to the disruption of the natural systems 
and global warming.

Student clubs, organizations and the government have taken measures to curb the exhaustion of nature and 
extinction of the life it supports. Some of these include:

Adapting sustainable modes of survival
Conserving all forms of energy
Limiting the use of vehicles that release pollutants
Mass afforestation in different areas
Implementing methods to meet the minimums tree cover required
Switching to organic agriculture as much as possible
Reusing and recycling goods
Spreading awareness among people near us

History is a witness to the extinction of organisms as large as dinosaurs and the survival of animals as 
minute as ants. In addition to other factors, it is inevitable to remember that nature can take up both 
constructive and destructive roles. Through natural calamities, pandemics and natural crisis situations, 
nature has well explained the need for us to conserve nature so as to continue life on Earth for our future 
generations.

"
tech,"

In the broadest sense, economic development might be viewed as “any growth in real income per capita from 
whatever source”. Bach has described it as “growth in the total output of goods and services in the economy”. 
Novack has referred to a very old definition of economic growth, according to which it is “continuous 
substantial increase in per capita consumption of goods and services”.

The substantial consumption of economic goods is possible only when there is substantial production of 
economic goods, and sub­stantial production these days depends upon greater use of technologies. In a 
narrower sense, therefore, it may be said that economic development refers to “the extensive application of 
inanimate power and other tech­nologies to the production and distribution of economic goods”.

In this sense, economic development is practically equivalent to industrialisation. But to say that economic 
development is only indus­trialisation would not be correct because besides involving the use of power and 
technology in production, it also involves labour mobility, ex­tensive educational system, and so on.

Jaffe and Stewart (1951), who described economic development as “rationalization of economic production”, 
have given a dichotomy of de­veloped and underdeveloped countries on the basis of per capita income and 
factors like high literacy, high expectation of life at birth and low fertility, low proportion of labour 
force engaged in agriculture, and high production of kilowatts of electricity per capita.

Besides these, we may add a third category to this classification, that of a country which is in between 
the developed and the underdeveloped countries, that is, the developing country. In terms of the per capita 
income, the United States, Canada, Australia and Western Europe (Italy, France, Germany, and England) are 
considered to be developed countries. On the other hand, South Africa, Mexico and most of the southern and 
eastern European countries are developing countries. India too, in terms of its per capita income, is a 
developing country.

Jaffe and Stewart have said that economic development entail; changes in everything at once to achieve the 
above characteristics (of de­veloped countries). But, Robert Paris believes that this conclusion (of achieving 
everything at once for economic development) is not justified. He thinks that though its proximate measurement 
will be taken as an in­crease in real income per capita, yet all other changes would depend upon the degree of 
requiredness.

"

Government! You can't live with it! You can't live without it! It is the ""common cold"" that everyone dreads. 
The American Heritage College Dictionary, Third Edition defines government as, ""The exercise of authority in 
a political unit in order to control and administer public policy."" Webster's Desk Dictionary of the English 
Language defines government as, ""The political direction and control exercised over a nation, state, 
community, etc."" The common individual might define government as the root of all evil. The thing about 
government is that no one stops to think about how government came about. 

Government falls into two categories; monarchy or a republic. A monarchy is a form of government that is 
always headed by 

King Fahad has complete control over it's citizens in all aspects pertaining to their country. 
Laws, punishments, and regulations are in the hands of King Fahad. 


If the government of a country does not fall into any of these categories, it is a republic. A 
republic is defined in Webster's Desk Dictionary of the English Language as any government in which the 
supreme power rests in the body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by representatives chosen 
directly or indirectly by them. There are three types of republics; dictatorship, oligarchy, or democracy. 


A dictatorship is a republic ruled by one individual. Cuba has a dictatorship. Fidel Castro is the main 
contributor to Cuban society. He oversees his people yet allows his people the right to vote him in or out 
of office. 


An oligarchy is another type of republic. This type is ruled by a select few. An example of an oligarchic 
society would be France. King Louis XV is king but he has a complete parliament to assist him in the law 
making procedure of France. 

The third type of republic is a democracy. A democracy is defined as a society ruled by the majority. 
An example of a democratic republic would be the United States.
