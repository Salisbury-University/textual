High school and collegiate career[edit]
Roosevelt attended St. Joseph's Collegiate Institute in Buffalo where he played at the quarterback position before staying in Buffalo to attend the University at Buffalo. Roosevelt was the first recruit of new head coach Turner Gill. He started seven games as a freshman and was converted into a wide receiver, catching 31 passes and 2 touchdowns. In his second year, the wide receiver caught 63 passes and 4 touchdowns. In his junior season, Roosevelt dramatically increased his production, catching 104 passes, primarily from quarterback Drew Willy.
On September 13, 2008 Roosevelt caught a Hail Mary pass from QB Drew Willy as time expired against the Temple Owls. Also in his junior season, Buffalo won the 2008 MAC Championship Game against Nate Davis and the Ball State Cardinals. Roosevelt's 104 receptions was one short of the MAC Conference record at the time.[1] Roosevelt graduated in 2009 and, the following season, Roosevelt caught 70 passes and 9 touchdowns.[2]
Professional career[edit]
NFL[edit]
Roosevelt went undrafted in the 2010 NFL Draft. He was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Buffalo Bills on April 24.[3] Roosevelt was cut by the Bills on final cuts on September 4, 2010, but signed to their practice squad on September 5, 2010. On November 27, 2010, Roosevelt was promoted from the practice squad to the active roster. On October 16, 2011, Roosevelt caught his first pro TD pass, a 60-yard catch-and-run at MetLife Stadium against the New York Giants.[4]
On August 31, 2012, he was cut by the Bills. On July 23, 2013, he was signed by the Cleveland Browns. After the 2013 season, he was not re-signed and was signed after a tryout for the Detroit Lions on April 23, 2014.[5]  After being let go by the Lions, he signed with the Buffalo Bills on July 21, 2014.[6] The Bills released Roosevelt on August 29, 2014.[7] On October 3, 2014 the Bills re-signed Roosevelt to the practice squad. He was released from the practice squad on October 4, 2014.
Saskatchewan Roughriders[edit]
Roosevelt signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League on March 14, 2015.[8] Roosevelt had a breakout year for the Roughriders in his second season in the CFL. He played in the first 11 games of the season before being placed on the six-game injured list.[9] Following the season he was named the Riders Most Outstanding Player despite missing 7 games. Additionally, he accepted a two-year contract extension from the Riders.[10] Roosevelt finished the 2016 season with 1,095 receiving yards, the ninth-highest total in the league.[11] In Week 14 of the 2017 season Roosevelt took a helmet-to-helmet hit from Calgary's Tunde Adeleke and was placed on the team's six-game injured list. At the time of the injury Roosevelt was the Riders leading receiver, and had the fifth most receiving yards in the league with 923.[12] Roosevelt was named a divisional All-Star for 2017 after another 1,000 yard season and 8 touchdown catches, but had a down year in 2018 with injuries to both himself, as well as several injuries to new starting quarterback Zach Collaros.[13] The Roughriders offense had already taken hits prior to and during the regular season with the release of experienced pass catchers such as Rob Bagg, Chad Owens, Bakari Grant,[14] and Duron Carter.[15] Several days into free agency for 2019, Roosevelt turned down an offer from rival Winnipeg to sign a one year extension with the Roughriders for roughly $160,000 Canadian Dollars, as well as performance incentives to increase earnings.[16] Roosevelt rewarded the Riders with a bounce-back year; he played his first season of all 18 games, and despite only one touchdown catch, he caught 77 passes for 946 yards, with which Roosevelt surpassed the 4,000 yard mark for his career, as well as making his 300th catch. Following the season he was not re-signed by the Riders and became a free agent on February 11, 2020.
Montreal Alouettes[edit]
On February 22, 2020, Roosevelt signed with the Montreal Alouettes.[17] He signed a contract extension with the team on December 18, 2020.[18] He was released on July 26, 2021.[19]
Winnipeg Blue Bombers[edit]
On August 30, 2021, Roosevelt signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.[20] He was released by the Bombers' practice roster on November 19, 2021 without having appeared in a game for the team.[21]

Transdifferentiation, also known as lineage reprogramming,[1] is the process in which one mature somatic cell is transformed into another mature somatic cell without undergoing an intermediate pluripotent state or progenitor cell type.[2] It is a type of metaplasia, which includes all cell fate switches, including the interconversion of stem cells. Current uses of transdifferentiation include disease modeling and drug discovery and in the future may include gene therapy and regenerative medicine.[3] The term 'transdifferentiation' was originally coined by Selman and Kafatos[4] in 1974 to describe a change in cell properties as cuticle producing cells became salt-secreting cells in silk moths undergoing metamorphosis.[5]

Discovery[edit]
Davis et al. 1987 reported the first instance (sight) of transdifferentiation where a cell changed from one adult cell type to another. Forcing mouse embryonic fibroblasts to express MyoD was found to be sufficient to turn those cells into myoblasts.[6]
Natural examples[edit]
The only known instances where adult cells change directly from one lineage to another occurs in the species Turritopsis dohrnii (which is also known as the immortal jellyfish) and Turritopsis Nutricula (the protozoan which makes the immortal jellyfish immortal). Rather, cells dedifferentiate and then redifferentiate into the cell type of interest. In newts when the eye lens is removed, pigmented epithelial cells de-differentiate and then redifferentiate into the lens cells.[7] Vincenzo Colucci described this phenomenon in 1891 and Gustav Wolff described the same thing in 1894; the priority issue is examined in Holland (2021). [8] In the pancreas, it has been demonstrated that alpha cells can spontaneously switch fate and transdifferentiate into beta cells in both healthy and diabetic human and mouse pancreatic islets.[9] While it was previously believed that oesophageal cells were developed from the transdifferentiation of smooth muscle cells, that has been shown to be false.[10]
Induced and therapeutic examples[edit]
The first example of functional transdifferentiation has been provided by Ferber et al.[11] by inducing a shift in the developmental fate of cells in the liver and converting them into 'pancreatic beta-cell-like' cells. The cells induced a wide, functional and long-lasting transdifferentiation process that reduced the effects of hyperglycemia in diabetic mice.[12] Moreover, the trans-differentiated beta-like cells were found to be resistant to the autoimmune attack that characterizes type 1 diabetes.[13]
The second step was to undergo transdifferentiation in human specimens. By transducing liver cells with a single gene, Sapir et al. were able to induce human liver cells to transdifferentiate into human beta cells.[14]
This approach has been demonstrated in mice, rat, xenopus and human tissues (Al-Hasani et al., 2013).[citation needed]
Schematic model of the hepatocyte-to-beta cell transdifferentiation process. Hepatocytes are obtained by liver biopsy from diabetic patient, cultured and expanded ex vivo, transduced with a PDX1 virus, transdifferentiated into functional insulin-producing beta cells, and transplanted back into the patient.[14]
Granulosa and theca cells in the ovaries of adult female mice can transdifferentiate to Sertoli and Leydig cells via induced knockout of the FOXL2 gene.[15] Similarly, Sertoli cells in the testes of adult male mice can transdifferentiate to granulosa cells via induced knockout of the DMRT1 gene.[16]
Methods[edit]
Lineage-instructive approach[edit]
In this approach, transcription factors from progenitor cells of the target cell type are transfected into a somatic cell to induce transdifferentiation.[2] There exists two different means of determining which transcription factors to use: by starting with a large pool and narrowing down factors one by one[17] or by starting with one or two and adding more.[18] One theory to explain the exact specifics is that ectopic Transcriptional factors direct the cell to an earlier progenitor state and then redirects it towards a new cell type. Rearrangement of the chromatin structure via DNA methylation or histone modification may play a role as well.[19] Here is a list of in vitro examples and in vivo examples. In vivo methods of transfecting specific mouse cells utilize the same kinds of vectors as in vitro experiments, except that the vector is injected into a specific organ. Zhou et al. (2008) injected Ngn3, Pdx1 and Mafa into the dorsal splenic lobe (pancreas) of mice to reprogram pancreatic exocrine cells into β-cells in order to ameliorate hyperglycaemia.[20]
Initial epigenetic activation phase approach[edit]
Somatic cells are first transfected with pluripotent reprogramming factors temporarily (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, etc.) before being transfected with the desired inhibitory or activating factors.[21] Here is a list of examples in vitro.
Pharmacological agents[edit]
The DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-azacytidine is also known to promote phenotypic transdifferentiation of cardiac cells to skeletal myoblasts.[22]
In prostate cancer, treatment with androgen receptor targeted therapies induces neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in a subset of patients.[23][24] No standard of care exists for these patients, and those diagnosed with treatment induced neuroendocrine carcinoma are typically treated palliatively.[25]
Mechanism of action[edit]
The transcription factors serve as a short term trigger to an irreversible process. The transdifferentiation liver cells observed 8 months after one single injection of pdx1.[12]
The ectopic transcription factors turn off the host repertoire of gene expression in each of the cells. However, the alternate desired repertoire is being turned on only in a subpopulation of predisposed cells.[26] Despite the massive dedifferentiation – lineage tracing approach indeed demonstrates that transdifferentiation originates in adult cells.[27]
Mogrify algorithm[edit]
Determining the unique set of cellular factors that is needed to be manipulated for each cell conversion is a long and costly process that involved much trial and error. As a result, this first step of identifying the key set of cellular factors for cell conversion is the major obstacle researchers face in the field of cell reprogramming. An international team of researchers have developed an algorithm, called Mogrify(1), that can predict the optimal set of cellular factors required to convert one human cell type to another. When tested, Mogrify was able to accurately predict the set of cellular factors required for previously published cell conversions correctly. To further validate Mogrify's predictive ability, the team conducted two novel cell conversions in the laboratory using human cells, and these were successful in both attempts solely using the predictions of Mogrify.[28][29][30] Mogrify has been made available online for other researchers and scientists.
Issues[edit]
Evaluation[edit]
When examining transdifferentiated cells, it is important to look for markers of the target cell type and the absence of donor cell markers which can be accomplished using green fluorescent protein or immunodetection. It is also important to examine the cell function, epigenome, transcriptome, and proteome profiles. Cells can also be evaluated based upon their ability to integrate into the corresponding tissue in vivo[17] and functionally replace its natural counterpart. In one study, transdifferentiating tail-tip fibroblasts into hepatocyte-like cells using transcription factors Gata4, Hnf1α and Foxa3, and inactivation of p19(Arf) restored hepatocyte-like liver functions in only half of the mice using survival as a means of evaluation.[31]
Transition from mouse to human cells[edit]
Generally transdifferentiation that occurs in mouse cells does not translate in effectiveness or speediness in human cells. Pang et al. found that while transcription factors Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l turned mouse cells into mature neurons, the same set of factors only turned human cells into immature neurons. However, the addition of NeuroD1 was able to increase efficiency and help cells reach maturity.[32]
Order of transcription factor expression[edit]
The order of expression of transcription factors can direct the fate of the cell. Iwasaki et al. (2006) showed that in hematopoietic lineages, the expression timing of Gata-2 and (C/EBPalpha) can change whether or not a lymphoid-committed progenitors can differentiate into granulocyte/monocyte progenitor, eosinophil, basophil or bipotent basophil/mast cell progenitor lineages.[33]
Immunogenicity[edit]
It has been found for induced pluripotent stem cells that when injected into mice, the immune system of the synergeic mouse rejected the teratomas forming. Part of this may be because the immune system recognized epigenetic markers of specific sequences of the injected cells. However, when embryonic stem cells were injected, the immune response was much lower. Whether or not this will occur within transdifferentiated cells remains to be researched.[3]
Method of transfection[edit]
In order to accomplish transfection, one may use integrating viral vectors such as lentiviruses or retroviruses, non-integrating vectors such as Sendai viruses or adenoviruses, microRNAs and a variety of other methods including using proteins and plasmids;[34] one example is the non-viral delivery of transcription factor-encoding plasmids with a polymeric carrier to elicit neuronal transdifferentiation of fibroblasts.[35] When foreign molecules enter cells, one must take into account the possible drawbacks and potential to cause tumorous growth. Integrating viral vectors have the chance to cause mutations when inserted into the genome. One method of going around this is to excise the viral vector once reprogramming has occurred, an example being Cre-Lox recombination[36] Non-integrating vectors have other issues concerning efficiency of reprogramming and also the removal of the vector.[37] Other methods are relatively new fields and much remains to be discovered.
Pluripotent reprogramming[edit]
Almost all factors that reprogram cells into pluripotency have been discovered and can turn a wide variety of cells back into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). However, many of the reprogramming factors that can change a cell's lineage have not been discovered and these factors apply only for that specific lineage.[38]
The final products of transdifferentiated cells are capable of being used for clinical studies, but iPSCs must be differentiated.[38]
It may become possible in the future to use transdifferentiation in vivo, whereas pluripotent reprogramming may cause teratomas in vivo.[38]
Transdifferentiated cells will require less epigenetic marks to be reset, whereas pluripotent reprogramming requires nearly all to be removed, which may become an issue during redifferentiation.[38]
Transdifferentiation is geared towards moving between similar lineages, whereas pluripotent reprogramming has unlimited potential.[38]
Pluripotent cells are capable of self-renewal and often go through many cell passages, which increases the chance of accumulating mutations. Cell culture may also favor cells that are adapted for surviving under those conditions, as opposed to inside an organism. Transdifferentiation requires fewer cell passages and would reduce the chance of mutations.[38]
Transdifferentiation can also be much more efficient than pluripotency reprogramming due to the extra step involved in the latter process.[39]
Both pluripotent and transdifferentiated cells use adult cells, thus starting cells are very accessible, whereas human embryonic stem cells require that one navigate legal loopholes and delve into the morality of stem cell research debate.

Life[edit]
 Memorial plaque at the house Pariser Platz 4 in Berlin-Mitte
Breslauer was born in Berlin and studied architecture at the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg. During his studies he became a member of the Akademischer Verein Motiv.[1] After his studies, he initially worked as a trainee architect and assessor in the Prussian civil service, including in the Prussian Ministry of Public Works in Berlin. In 1897 he left the civil service and became an employee of the well-known architect Alfred Messel.
From 1901 to 1934 he worked independently with the architect Paul Salinger - his brother-in-law.[2]
In 1921 Breslauer was appointed as a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts.[3] On December 9, 1933, he was expelled from the Academy by the Nazis because of his Jewish ancestry. In 1939, he emigrated to Switzerland.[4]
Breslauer was married to Dorothea Lessing, a daughter of the art historian Julius Lessing.[5] Their joint daughter was the photographer and art dealer Marianne Breslauer (1909-2001).
His eldest daughter was Agathe Saulmann. He died in Zurich.
The exclusion was reversed in November 1945 following the defait of Nazi Germany.
Work[edit]
Buildings[edit]
Buildings designed by Breslauer can still be found in large numbers in Berlin, some of which are listed as historic monuments.[6]
Built in 1903 and 1904 by Breslauer and Salinger, the R. M. Maaßen department store on Oranienplatz in Berlin-Kreuzberg was, according to the company's self-description, Germany's "largest specialty store for women's clothing." It was altered in 1938, badly damaged during the war and completely rebuilt in the 1950s. From 2002 to 2004, the house was renovated, approximating its original appearance.
In 1905, the architects Breslauer and Salinger built a five-story private clinic in Berlin-Tiergarten for the physician Ernst Unger. Today, the building bears the name Haus Unger.
The villa for the banker Carl Joerger on Lake Pohlesee in Berlin-Wannsee, also built by Breslauer and Salinger from 1906 to 1907, is also a listed building and is used as a youth education center WannseeForum.[7]

Early life[edit]
Berry was born and raised in California, the son of author Joy Berry.[1] He began his apprenticeship in Sebastopol, California aged 15 with drummer Titos Sompa, one of the founders of the African drum and dance scene on the West Coast of the U.S.
Career[edit]
Travelling with Sompa, he moved to Africa aged 19.[1] Originally arriving in Congo’s Brazzaville, his fascination of Zimbabwean mbira music led him to Zimbabwe’s capital Harare,[1] where he settled and studied under mbira master Monderek Muchena for ten years. Eight of these years were under the Mugabe Regime. During this tumultuous political period, Berry lived in ghettos and villages  where he studied the music of the Shona people.
Encouraged by his teachers to create his own compositions, he formed the band Panjea, which fused funk with elements of hip-hop, Afro-pop and traditional African music. The band won a talent contest and secured a record deal.[1] They had No. 1 hits on the radio, toured Africa, and reached Platinum on an album they recorded with Zimbabwean-based Gramma Records.
Berry was warned to leave Zimbabwe due to his lyrical opposition to the government. After four of Panjea's band members succumbed to AIDS, Berry left Zimbabwe. He has since been based in Brooklyn, NY and Hawaii.
Berry has toured North and Central America, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Asia and Africa as a frontman and bandleader, and has headlined music festivals around the world. He performed the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia[citation needed]; was guest musician and composer on Paul Winter's Grammy Award Winning 2005 "Silver Solstice" Album [2]
Berry taught music and culture as a guest faculty member at Oberlin and Berklee Colleges of Music, University of Colorado Boulder, Williams College, Stanford University as well as his own Panjea Foundation for Cultural Education.
Berry has collaborated with Steve Kimock, members of the Brazilian Girls, Baaba Maal, Thomas Mapfumo, Oliver Mutukudzi, Manu Dibango, Xavier Rudd, String Cheese Incident, Eminem, Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann, Senegalese Afro-pop artist Yousoou N'dour, Cuban musicians Los Munequitos de Mantanzas, jazz artist Paul Winter, Jamaican rhythm and production duo Sly and Robbie, and Fugee's producer Handel Tucker.
Berry spent six months working and recording with the Central African Republic Pymies to score the soundtrack for the film "Oka!"
Berry worked with Maverick label Kanaga System Krush on his album, "King Of Me", electrifying the mbira through a special bass and guitar rig; singing and playing bass, rhythm and melodies with Ivorian musician Abou Diarrassouba on drums.
Reception[edit]
A reviewer for the Sydney Morning Herald found Berry's performance was "little more than merely showing off his undoubted virtuosity" and his lyrics were "idle platitudes".[3]
Pop Matters said his 2006 album Dancemakers "fails spectacularly" and the lyrics are uninspired.[4]

The Shtokman field (also Stockman field; Russian: Штокмановское месторождение), one of the world's largest natural gas fields, lies in the northwestern part of the South Barents Basin[1] in the Russian sector of the Barents Sea, 600 kilometres (370 mi) north of Kola Peninsula. Its reserves are estimated at 3.8 trillion cubic metres (130 trillion cubic feet) of natural gas and more than 37 million tons of gas condensate.[2]

History[edit]
The Shtokman field was discovered in 1988. It was named after the Soviet geophysicist Vladimir Shtokman (Russian: Владимир Штокман), a descendant of German emigrants, whose name was originally spelled Stockmann.
In the early 1990s, Gazprom started talks with a group of five Western companies to participate in the field's development. In 1992, the foreign consortium was pushed out by the Rosshelf consortium, a Gazprom subsidiary that comprised 19 Russian companies. in August 1995, Gazprom and Rosshelf signed a letter of intent with Norsk Hydro of Norway, Conoco Inc. of the United States, Neste Oy of Finland, and TotalEnergies of France to evaluate the possible joint development of Shtokman field.[3][4]
In January 1996, a project of a large floating liquefaction plant was designed, but this plan was abandoned and in March 2000, Rosshelf began developing plans for production and construction of a natural gas pipeline from the field via Murmansk to Vyborg.[3] In 2001, Gazprom announced its intention to develop the gas field together with Rosneft. In 2002, the license for the field development and recovery was transferred from Rosshelf to Sevmorneftegas.[4]
On 20 June 2005, Russia and Norway signed a number of agreements related to development of Shtokman field. On 28 June 2005 Russia signed a memorandum with France. In August 2005, Gazprom received bids from ConocoPhillips, ExxonMobil,
Norsk Hydro, Statoil, Mitsui, Sumitomo Corporation, Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron Corporation, and TotalEnergies to develop the field.[3] In September 2005, Gazprom selected five companies—Statoil, Norsk Hydro, TotalEnergies, Chevron and ConocoPhillips—as finalists in a search for partners to develop the field, but in October 2006 decided to reject all potential partners.[5][6]
On 13 July 2007, Gazprom and French energy company TotalEnergies signed a framework agreement to organize the design, financing, construction and operation of the Shtokman phase one infrastructure.[7][8] On 25 October 2007, similar contract was signed between Gazprom and StatoilHydro (later Statoil, now Equinor).[9] The consortium of three companies, Shtokman Development AG, was established on 21 February 2008 in Zug, Switzerland.[10]
Due to the global LNG oversupply and the United States shale gas, the shareholders of the project decided in 2010 to postpone it for 3 years.[11] Based on this, the pipeline gas production might start in 2016 and LNG production in 2017.[12][13]
The shareholders agreement expired on 30 June 2012 without development started. Statoil wrote off its investment into the project and handed shares back to Gazprom.[14] In August 2012, Gazprom put the project on hold with a final investment decision on the first phase postponed until at least 2014, citing high costs and low gas prices.[15][16] However, the company confirmed being in talks with foreign partners to find a new business model for the project.[17]  There are speculations that Royal Dutch Shell may become a project partner.[14]
The Shtokman project was postponed indefinitely in May 2019, and Gazprom closed down the Shtokman Development AG.[18]
Development[edit]
The field so far was not developed owing to extreme Arctic conditions and the depth of the sea varying from 320 to 340 metres (1,050 to 1,120 ft).[19] In September 2006, Gazprom completed drilling of appraisal well No. 7 in the field.[19] Russian scientists have warned that the Shtokman's development may face problems as global warming unleashes vast icebergs into the Arctic.[20] The Shtokman Development Company plans to address this challenge by using floating removable platforms, which can be moved around in case of emergency situations.[21]
Originally it was planned to ship Shtokman's gas to the United States as liquid natural gas (LNG). Later it was indicated by Gazprom that the majority of produced natural gas would be sold to Europe via the planned Nord Stream 2 pipeline.[22][23] For this purpose, the pipeline from the Shtokman field to the Murmansk Oblast and further via Kola peninsula to Volkhov in the Leningrad Oblast will be built.[24] The LNG plant will be laid in by the village of Teriberka, about 100 kilometres (62 mi) north-east of Murmansk.[23][24]
The front-end engineering and design (FEED) is divided between different companies. The onshore transportation and technological complex, including an LNG plant, will be prepared by Technip.[25] DORIS Engineering will prepare the subsea production system and the offshore technological platform. JP Kenny, a subsidiary of Wood Group, will design together with Rubin Design Bureau and Giprospetsgaz, a subsidiary of Gazprom, the 600 kilometres (370 mi) long 44 inches (1,120 mm) subsea pipeline from the Shtokman field to south of Murmansk.[26][27] WorleyParsons and its subsidiary INTECSEA will perform FEED of the production vessel, which will process produced gas before transportation onshore.[28]
Geology[edit]
The main reservoir is of Upper Jurassic age, with a smaller amount of gas in the Middle Jurassic and the trapping structure is a large anticline, sealed by Upper Jurassic shales.[29]
Technical features[edit]
At the initial stage the project is expected to produce 22.5 billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas and 205,000 tons of gas condensate annually. Later the production is expected to increase up to 70 bcm of natural gas and 0.6 million tonnes of gas condensate.[19] All extraction facilities will probably be located under water. The development costs are estimated at US$15 billion to US$20 billion, although according to the estimate by Alexander Medvedev, deputy chairman of Gazprom's management committee, the field's development costs will be only US$12 billion.[30]
Project company[edit]
The license to explore for and produce gas and condensate on the Shtokman field is owned by Russian company Gazprom Shelf Dobycha (formerly Sevmorneftegaz), a wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprom. Gazprom Shelf Dobycha is a sole customer for the design and construction of the field infrastructure, including a production complex, a pipeline network and an LNG plant, and has all marketing rights for hydrocarbons of the Shtokman field.[7][31][32] Shtokman Development AG was to bear all financial, geological and technical risks related to the production activities.[10] Gazprom owned 51% of shares in Shtokman Development, while TotalEnergies had 25% and Statoil 24% of shares.[9][33][34] Head of the company was Yury Komarov.[35] Shtokman Development was to own infrastructure for 25 years from field commissioning. Upon completion of phase one, TotalEnergies and Statoil should transfer their shares in Shtokman Development AG to Gazprom.[7]

Further information: Carnival in the Netherlands
The national holidays in the Netherlands are:
Date
English name
Dutch name
Notes
1 January
New Year's Day
Nieuwjaarsdag
March or April
Good Friday
Goede Vrijdag
This is a national holiday, but not a mandatory paid holiday and a normal workday for most employees.[1] It is a popular day off due to the Easter weekend, especially the combination with Easter Monday.
March or April
Easter
Pasen
The Netherlands have a two-day holiday, called Eerste Paasdag on Sunday and Tweede Paasdag on Monday (lit. First Easter Day and Second Easter Day)
27 April
King's Day
Koningsdag
If 27 April falls on a Sunday, King's Day is celebrated on the 26th.
5 May
Liberation Day
Bevrijdingsdag
This is a national holiday, but not a mandatory paid holiday for everyone.[2] It is custom for many employers to grant a paid holiday every 5 years on this day. Public offices and schools are closed on this day every year, though.[3]
40 days after Easter
Ascension Day
Hemelvaartsdag
The subsequent Friday is a popular day off for many people, though it is not a paid holiday.[4]
7 weeks after Easter
Pentecost
Pinksteren
A two-day holiday (Sunday and the subsequent Monday), called Eerste Pinkstersdag and Tweede Pinksterdag (lit. First Pentecost Day and Second Pentecost Day)
25 & 26 December
Christmas
Kerstmis
Like Easter and Pentecost, the Netherlands celebrate two days of Christmas, called Eerste Kerstdag and Tweede Kerstdag (lit. First Christmas Day and Second Christmas Day)
While there are other holidays that are widely celebrated, these are not officially recognised national holidays. They are as follows:
While Saint Nicholas's Eve (the eve of Sinterklaas, also called Sinterklaasavond or Pakjesavond) on 5 December is not a national holiday, it is widely celebrated. Saint Nicholas's traditional name day is on 6 December; it is however Saint Nicholas's Eve, the day before, which is the focus of celebrations in the Netherlands.
In the south and east of the Netherlands, Carnival is celebrated. It is celebrated on the three days before Ash Wednesday. The earliest possible date is on 1 February, the latest possible date is 9 March. Though not an official holiday, many people, particularly in the south, take the week off to celebrate. Schools in both regions schedule their spring holiday at the same time.[5]
There has been some debate over whether the Islamic holiday of Eid ul-Fitr (Suikerfeest in Dutch, lit. 'Sugar festival') should be a national holiday. This was met by opposition from right-wing political parties such as the PVV and SGP. For now, Eid ul-Fitr is not an official national holiday, but it usually justifies a day off for Islamic employees. Those opposed to this proposition say that there are enough national holidays as it is. Schools are still able to give additional days off for this purpose.[5]

500cc race report[edit]
This race was most notable for Mick Doohan's victory and subsequent fourth title conquest, the battle for the win between Mick Doohan and Tadayuki Okada and the fight for third position between Alex Barros and Luca Cadalora.
Mick Doohan is on pole - his eighth consecutive pole position of the year -, setting a time of 1:32.872 on the Saturday. In second place is Carlos Checa, third place is Alex Barros and fourth place is Tadayuki Okada. The second row of the grid consists of Doriano Romboni in fifth, Nobuatsu Aoki in sixth, Luca Cadalora in seventh and Kenny Roberts Jr. in eighth. Àlex Crivillé was still out of contention due to a fall at one of the free practice sessions at the Dutch round, sustaining serious tendon and bone damage as well as lesions of the blood vessels in his left wrist. His left thumb was badly injured. As a result, he has undergone an operation and has to wait until September to ride again.[3][4]
All riders take off and do their usual warm-up lap before lining up in their respective grid slots. As the lights go out, both Barros and Checa get a good getaway heading into Redgate (Turn 1), Checa initially leading but getting overtaken upon entry. Norifumi Abe also has a fantastic start from eleventh on the grid to slot behind into third, then second place after Checa loses out. Okada is fourth and Doohan - who has a mediocre start - slots behind into fifth. Cadalora is sixth. At the Old Hairpin, Barros has already opened up a small gap to Abe. With Checa losing out after a good start, he is now seventh behind Takuma Aoki on the opening lap. Régis Laconi is already out of the race, distraught looking at his bike as the marshalls are taking care of it. At the end of Starkey's Straight, Okada makes a move on Abe and passes him for second place heading into The Esses (Turn 9). Checa also tries a move, going down the inside of Oaki and taking sixth place as a result. Doohan then does the same to the Japanese, gently going up his inside at the Melbourne Hairpin (Turn 10) to pass him for third.
On lap two, Barros leads the way but is already losing ground to Okada. The top six is as follows: Barros, Okada, Doohan, Abe, Cadalora and Checa. At the Old Hairpin, T. Aoki goes wide and loses metres to Checa. At Coppice (Turn 8), Okada has by now closed the gap to Barros and tries a move around the outside of the Brazilian but he holds on heading into The Esses. At the Melbourne Hairpin, Doohan then goes up the inside of teammate Okada and overtakes him for second spot.
Lap three and Doohan easily blasts past Barros for the lead at Wheatcroft Straight. At the exit of McLean's, Checa does a low-speed highside and crashes out of a strong fifth place. He slides onto the edge of the track and into the grass, then runs away from the crash site being assisted by the marshalls as he disappointingly puts his hands on his helmet, the other marshalls then recovering his bike. This now promotes N. Aoki to sixth place.
On lap four, Doohan is leading the way followed by Barros. Exiting the Melbourne Hairpin, he has a moment but does not lose any time.
Lap five and Okada has closed up fully on Barros at the end of Wheatcroft Straight but is not able to get by. Barros sets the fastest lap of the race. The top six is as follows: Doohan, Barros, Okada, Abe, Cadalora, and N. Aoki. At the end of Starkey's Straight, Okada goes side by side with Barros and takes second position. It's now a Repsol Honda 1–2.
On lap six, N. Aoki is closing up to the rear of Cadalora. Anthony Gobert on the Lucky Strike Suzuki is going slowly but also doing a wheelie, having to retire due to technical problems. Abe is also slowly reeling in Barros now.
Lap seven and Okada now sets the fastest lap and is closing the gap to Doohan. No overtakes happened at the front.
On lap eight, the top six is as follows: Doohan, Okada, Barros, Abe, Cadalora and N. Aoki. Okada has now almost caught up to the back of Doohan, with N. Aoki doing likewise to Cadalora.
Lap nine and Okada has closed the gap to his teammate at the Melbourne Hairpin. Exiting the hairpin, Doohan has a bit of a moment but does not lose any time or places from it.
On lap ten, the top six is as follows: Doohan, Okada, Barros, Abe, Cadalora and N. Aoki. Fourth place Abe is now being hunted down by Cadalora, himself also coming under pressure from N. Aoki as well.
Lap eleven and Juan Borja tries a move down the inside of T. Aoki at Redgate for eighth but isn't able to get by. Daryl Beattie has already passed the Japanese and is now seventh. At the end of Starkey's Straight, Alberto Puig slams on the brakes very late and almost goes wide entering The Esses.
On lap twelve, Doohan and Okada have pulled a considerable gap to Barros by now. The top six is as follows: Doohan, Okada, Barros, Abe, Cadalora and N. Aoki.
Lap thirteen and Doohan still leads with Okada right behind him. No overtakes happened at the front.
On lap fourteen, Abe has closed up to Barros for third place. Doohan's gap to Okada is +0.250 seconds.
Lap fifteen - the halfway point of the race - and Abe has now fully closed the gap to Barros. Okada's gap back to Barros is +4.429 seconds. At Starkey's Straight, Abe tries a move on the Brazilian but he defends well on the brakes, keeping the position entering The Esses.
On lap sixteen, Abe is right behind Barros at Wheatcroft Straight, then pulls out of the slipstream at the end of the straight and makes a late lunge to take third place upon entry of Redgate. However, Barros fights back right away: He stays very close at Hollywood (Turn 2) and goes up his inside at the entry of Craner Curves (Turn 3), making contact with Abe and forcing the Japanese to go straight on into the grass. He loses multiple places from it as a result but is able to stay on the bike. As a result, he has lost two places to Cadalora and N. Aoki and is now in sixth position.
Lap seventeen and the top six is as follows: Doohan, Okada, Barros, Cadalora, N. Aoki and Abe. Doohan's gap to Okada is now +0.326 seconds. Barros is now starting to come under pressure from Cadalora who is dragging N. Aoki with him as well.
On lap eighteen, Barros passes backmarker Laurent Naveau at the Wheatcroft Straight. Doohan sets the fastest lap as he still is being chased by Okada, though opening a small gap to him by now. N. Aoki is losing ground to Cadalora who is only closing the gap to Barros.
Lap nineteen and the top six is as follows: Doohan, Okada, Barros, Cadalora, N. Aoki and Beattie. At McLean's, Cadalora has now fully closed the gap to Barros. At the end of Starkey's Straight, Cadalora goes side by side with Barros, outbraking him and taking third entering The Esses. However, Cadalora runs a bit wide upon exit, allowing Barros to get back at him by diving down the inside at the Melbourne Hairpin, retaking the position. This has allowed N. Aoki to close up to the duo again.
On lap twenty, Cadalora goes past Barros at the end of the Wheatcroft Straight for third and is not able to get back at him this time around. However, Barros stays with Cadalora at McLean's and Coppice but loses out on the straight due to a lack of power. At Goddards (Turn 11), Okada makes a surprise lunge down the inside of teammate Doohan for first but runs wide and immediately gives back the position to Doohan.
Lap twenty-one and Okada makes another move on the Australian, going up his inside at Redgate and successfully taking the lead of the race.
On lap twenty-two, it is now Okada who leads the race, followed by Doohan in second. Third is now Cadalora, though he is still being harassed by Barros down in fourth. N. Aoki is also pretty close to the Brazilian. The top six is as follows: Okada, Doohan, Cadalora, Barros, N. Aoki and Beattie. Okada's gap back to Doohan is +0.421 seconds. Exiting Coppice, Barros is right behind Cadalorda, this time manages to stay close to the Italian at Starkey's Straight and makes a dive down his inside to retake third spot at The Esses.
Lap twenty-three and Cadalora closes up to Barros at Wheatcroft Straight but is not able to get past. He continues to stalk Barros all throughout the lap but is not able to get past. At the front, Okada is still leading with Doohan close behind him in second place.
On lap twenty-four, Cadalora closes up at Redgate as N. Aoki is starting to lose ground to the Italian again.
Lap twenty-five and Barros is coming under pressure from Cadalora again, using the Red Bull WCM Yamaha's superior power to get close, take a tighter line and go up the inside of Barros at Redgate for third. At the front, Doohan has overtaken Okada for the lead at the Old Hairpin, only to go wide and allow Okada to retake it entering Starkey's Bridge (Turn 5). Okada then in turn runs wide which gives Doohan the chance to pass entering Schwantz Curve (turn Turn 6). Okada is close at McLean's but with Doohan shutting the door on him, he is not able to make a move at Coppice.
On lap twenty-six, Puig has crashed out of the race, the rider walking unhurt to his bike as the marshalls recover it. Doohan slides his bike around Starkey's Bridge as Okada is doing everything he can to stay close to him. Cadalora has also passed Barros for third position again, the Brazilian still right behind him to try and retake it. Okada's gap to Cadalora is +17.654 seconds. As it looked like Barros was too far behind to make any sort of move, he makes an extremely late lunge up the inside of Cadalora at The Esses and somehow manages to get through. However, as Cadalora has a better exit out of the chicane, he goes past the Brazilian at the short straight before the Melbourne Loop and keeps third place. All the fighting has allowed N. Aoki to close up to the duo again.
Lap twenty-seven and N. Aoki goes past Barros on power at Wheatcroft Straight, taking fourth place away from him. Exiting the Old hairpin though, Barros is very close and retakes fourth by going up the inside of N. Aoki at Schwantz Curve. He then starts to slowly close the gap to Cadalora again.
On lap twenty-eight, Okada is still close to the rear of Doohan. The top six is as follows: Doohan, Okada, Cadalora, Barros, N. Aoki and Beattie. The gap Doohan has to Okada is +0.150 seconds. At the Melbourne Hairpin, Okada tries to go up the inside but backs out of it and almost slams into the back of his teammate. This allows Doohan to open up a small gap.
Lap twenty-nine, the penultimate lap, has started and Okada closes the gap to Doohan rather quickly, already practically behind him at the Old Hairpin. The top six is as follows: Doohan, Okada, Cadalora, Barros, N. Aoki and Beattie. Doohan's gap back to Okada is +0.399 seconds. Barros has managed to get by Cadalora and go up into third again.
Doohan crosses the line to start the final lap - lap thirty - with Okada close behind still. Barros looks behind to see how far behind Cadalora is at Wheatcroft Straight. Okada harasses Doohan all throughout the lap but thanks to his clever defending he manages to exit the last corner and cross the line to win the race - his tenth victory of the season and eleventh consecutive podium finish. Close second is Okada, followed by a jubilant Barros who does a wheelie upon crossing the line in third. Fourth is N. Aoki, fifth is Cadalora - who has faded towards the end - and sixth is Beattie.
Upon crossing the line, Doohan puts his fist up in the air in delight, then makes multiple hand gestures to signify his victory, looking back to see how close Okada was to him. Some Australian fans who have invaded the track give Doohan the Australian flag, the running back to the side as the marshalls look on and Doohan continues to ride, waving the flag proudly.
On the podium, Barros is the first to appear, followed by Okada and a happy Doohan as the crowd cheers for him upon entry. He has a short on that says "Mick Doohan 94 95 96 97 world champion". He puts his arm in the air, making a "1" gesture with his finger to show everyone he has won yet again. He waves at the crowd also briefly, then holds up his helmet as a sign of victory. The trophies get handed out, the first one to receive it being Barros, holding it up in the air happily. Next up is Okada, then Doohan who holds his trophy up with both hands in jubilant fashion. The Australian national anthem plays for Doohan. As it stops, the fans cheer and clap loudly for the now four-time world champion. All the riders receive a rosary on their necks, then the champagne gets handed out by the podium girls. As they do so, Doohan cheekily sprays one of them, then sprays Okada and then sprays it up in the air, with Okada also spraying one of the girls himself. Barros goes on to immediarly spray it on the crowd, Doohan also spraying some on him. Okada returns as he briefly went away from the podium and also sprays it on the crowd, with Doohan then spraying the cameraman also.
Doohan's victory now means he has an unassailable lead over his championship rivals, making him the 1997 world champion.

History[edit]
According to Kachin mythology, Manaw was first performed by Nat, spirits, and birds. Nat, spirits invited living creatures from land to participate in the Manaw dance in heaven. Only birds have participated. Afterward, birds came down to land and they taught humans how to dance Manaw dance.[1]
From another folk-tale, there were 9 Suns appeared on earth. Humans were suffered a lot from that incident. They decided to send birds to heaven for mercy. Birds were performed Manaw dance and sang for Nat, spirits. They were pleasured by their performance and they let them dance Manaw dance on earth. Later, men have emulated the dance from birds and started dance Manaw dance to worship Nat, spirits.[2]
Manaw ( Manau ) was called after the proverb " Masaw Nau Ningsan Jau". 'Masaw Ningsan' means heaven and above. 'Nau', 'Jau', 'Jaw' men give and worship. Manau means worship to God or heaven.[3]

CONCACAF Champions LeagueSelection Procedure
 Four US-based teams qualify for the 2018 CONCACAF Champions League:
The winner of the MLS Cup 2016 (Seattle Sounders FC);
The winner of the Supporters' Shield (FC Dallas);
The regular season conference champion that did not win the Supporters Shield (New York Red Bulls);
The winner of the 2016 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup (FC Dallas; already qualified, so berth passes to Colorado Rapids)
Should a team qualify through more than one method, or should a team from Canada occupy any MLS qualifying place, the next best US team in the overall table would take its place.
One Canada-based team qualifies for the Champions League (NOTE: Canadian teams cannot qualify through MLS):
The winner of the 2016 and 2017 Canadian Championship (Toronto FC)

History[edit]
In April 2021, Walt Disney Television chairman Dana Walden first mentioned the existence of a new BIPOC-focused programming initiative at Disney's General Entertainment Content division and Hulu.[3] Following the official launch of the brand on May 17, 2021, Onyx announced a number of upcoming projects produced by notable black creators including Questlove, Oprah Winfrey, and Prentice Penny.[4] Their first content acquisition, Summer of Soul, received a limited theatrical release in partnership with Searchlight Pictures on June 25, 2021, to critical acclaim before being released on Hulu the following weekend.[5]
In September 2021, Onyx Collective and Hulu greenlit the legal drama Reasonable Doubt for a series order, marking the first scripted series from the brand.[6]

Rotorua Airport (IATA: ROT, ICAO: NZRO) is an airport in Rotorua, New Zealand. It is located on Te Ngae Road (SH30) in the suburb of Rotokawa, approximately 6 km north east of Rotorua CBD. The terminal consists of a two-storey building with six tarmac gates and is home to a cafe, book store and conference room. There are general aviation hangars located to both the north and the south of the main terminal, as well as an avgas pump at the southern end of the apron. The airport's main runway (18R/36L) is 2114m long and is sealed with asphalt. There is also a shorter grass runway (18L/36R) which runs parallel to the main runway, although the proximity of the two runways means that they can't be used simultaneously.[2]
Currently, the airport is served by Air New Zealand's regional subsidiaries with flights to Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch. A number of charter and scenic airlines also operate from the airport on a regular basis. In the past, the airport has been served by a number of airlines on domestic routes including Ansett New Zealand, Origin Pacific Airways and Qantas. Qantas services were withdrawn in 2009 when Jetstar took over domestic flying from its parent.[3] The airport received international services for the first time in December 2009 when Air New Zealand began flights from Sydney, although this service ended in April 2015 due to lack of demand.

History[edit]

 Passengers disembarking from a Bombardier Q300, October 2010
 A Boeing 737-300 of the now defunct Freedom Air taxis along Runway 36L on 26 October 2005
Rotorua Airport opened in 1964, with a 1378m x 30m sealed runway that could accommodate National Airways Corporation's Douglas DC-3 and Fokker F27 aircraft. It replaced the old Whakarewarewa Aerodrome, which was located just north of Sala Street in what is now a residential area. In 2002, an extension to the southern end of the airport's runway brought its total length to 1622m. Plans to further increase the main runway's length in two stages, initially by 150 metres at the northern end followed by 487 metres at the southern end (including newly mandated overrun areas), were approved in 2008 after a lengthy consultation process and court battle.[4][5][6][7][8]
The initial increase in length would allow operations by Airbus A320 aircraft to Australia, albeit with capacity restrictions, and the subsequent southern extension would allow these aircraft to serve the airport without capacity restrictions.[9] The project was completed in 2009 and brought the combined length of the runway and overrun areas to 2,304 metres.[2] These extensions, in conjunction with the already-completed upgrade of the terminal building and facilities,[10] made the airport capable of handling international flights to Australia. Following the upgrade, Air New Zealand announced that it would begin flights between Rotorua and Sydney on 12 December 2009, the service being partially funded by the Rotorua District Council. To coincide with the introduction of international flights, the airport was renamed Rotorua International Airport.
The flights across the Tasman initially operated twice weekly (on Tuesdays and Saturdays),[11] but dropped to one flight a week during off-peak months before winter services were suspended entirely in 2014.[12] In October 2014, the Rotorua District Council decided, in conjunction with Air New Zealand, to stop subsidising the service as they felt that the amount they were funding, which equated to around $1 million per year, could be better spent on other initiatives. Therefore, it was announced that flights to Sydney would cease, and the final international flight from the airport was on 25 April 2015. Following the discontinuation of international flights, the airport stated that it was going to focus on strengthening domestic routes and was specifically interested in initiating non-stop flights to Queenstown.[13]
Controversy[edit]
The expansion of Rotorua Airport to an international airport has encountered both strong opposition and support from locals.[4][14] Critics cite concern over on-going debt servicing and operating costs, anticipated noise levels, the destruction of natural forest and privately owned planted trees to accommodate the newly lowered flight path, and potential safety issues. The Ngati Uenukukopako tribe, whose marae is located at the northern end of the runway, have taken a complaint to the New Zealand Human Rights Commission, and residents at the southern end of the runway continue to resist the Airport Company's programme to enforce cutting of trees which have been a longstanding feature of the area.[15][16][17]

Historical region in Upper Macedonia
"Lyncestis" redirects here. For genus of moths, see Lyncestis (moth).
 Lynkestis had been originally an autnomous kingdom in Upper Macedonia outside the original territory of the Kingdom of Macedon (blue area). After Philip II's expansion in the second half of the 4th century BC Lynkestis was incorporated into his kingdom (light blue area).
Lynkestis, Lyncestis, Lyngistis, Lynkos or Lyncus (Ancient Greek: Λυγκηστίς or Λύγκος Latin: Lyncestis or Lyncus) was a region and principality traditionally located in Upper Macedonia. It was the northernmost mountainous region of Upper Macedonia, located east of the Prespa Lakes.[1]
In its earlier history, Lynkestis was an independent polity ruled by a local dynasty which claimed descent from Bacchiadae, a Greek aristocratic family from ancient Corinth.[2][3] They were ruled by a basileus, as the rest of the tribes in Lower and Upper Macedonia.[4]
The few existing primary sources show that it maintained connections with the Illyrians and was frequently in hostilities with the Argeads.[3] The inhabitants of Lynkestis were known as Lyncestae or Lynkestai (Λυγκῆσται). Hecataeus (6th century BC) included them among the Molossians.[5] Thucydides (5th century BC) considered them Macedonians.[6][7] Later ancient sources considered them Illyrians.[6][8] Modern scholars regard them as Macedonians,[9] Illyrians,[10] or Epirotes (Molossians).[11]
In the second half of the 5th century BC Lynkestis was the strongest tribal state in Upper Macedonia under king Arrhabaeus, son of Bomerus.[12] During the Peloponnesian War the combined army of Lyncestians under king Arrhabaeus and Illyrians won against the joined forces of the Macedonian king Perdiccas II and the Spartan leader Brasidas at the Battle of Lyncestis in 423 BC.[13]
Lynkestis was annexed or retained by the Illyrian king Bardylis after his victory against Perdiccas III of Macedon in 360 BC.[14][15][16] At the Battle of Erigon Valley in 358 BC, the Illyrians under Bardylis were defeated by Phillip II and Lynkestis became part of Macedon. After his conquest, Philip founded Heraclea Lyncestis, which would become the main city of the area in antiquity. Although they became part of Macedon, Lynkestians retained their own basileus.[4]

Name[edit]
The etymology of the geographical name Lynkos/Lynkestis and tribal name Lynkestai is uncertain. It seems possible that the Greek word for "lynx" (λύγξ, λύγκος) came from the geographical names that contain the root Λυγκ- Lynk-, which either may refer to the lynx or not, and they may well be of Pre-Greek origin.[17]
Geography[edit]
Lynkestis was the northernmost mountainous region of Upper Macedonia, located east of the Prespa Lakes. Lynkestis bordered with Pelagonia to the northeast, Emathia and Almopia to the southeast, and Orestia, Eordaia and the Haliacmon river at some distance to the south. To the west Lynkestis bordered with Illyria. Lynkestis was strategically very important because the major east–west route and one of the north–south routes passed through the core of this region.[18]
Lynkestis was a small region but strategically situated as it was the entry point for Illyrian movements into central Macedonia.[3] The constant threat of Illyrian invasions through the region of Lynkestis into the Argead realm made its subjugation amongst the principal aims of the Argeads.[19] The Tsangon Pass was a mountain pass in the south of Little Prespa that linked the region of Lynkestis to southern Illyria.[20] Another important east-west route between Illyria and Macedonia was controlled by Heraclea Lyncestis, which was founded by Philip to prevent Illyrian raids from the west into Macedon.[21]

Lynkestis and the rest of Upper Macedonia was characterized by cold winters with rainfalls that were very heavy, and hot summers. In this region life was hard and mainly a matter of survival. According to the season of the year the mostly nomadic pastoralist people of the area moved their flocks of cattle, goats and sheeps to the various pasture lands.[22]
There were perhaps no towns of any size in Lynkestis prior to the foundation of Heraclea Lyncestis in the mid 4th century BC. The settlements were described only as "villages", which are typical of tribal peoples.[23] In Roman times, the Via Egnatia crossed the area and there were several Roman stations in it.[24]
History[edit]
Early period[edit]
The inhabitants of Lynkestis, like other peoples in Upper Macedonia, were mostly nomadic tribes, who were ruled by individual chieftains and who probably lived in basic settlements in the tribal areas instead of actual towns.[25] Their way of life was based on conditions which in general combined sedentary agriculture and transhumant pasturing.[26] Lynkestians, like other Upper Macedonians as well as Lower Macedonians, might well have believed they were descendants of the mythical figure of Makedon, claiming he was a son of Zeus, the chief god of their pantheon. However their chieftains had more in common with their Illyrian and Paeonian neighbors than their supposed countrymen, the Lower Macedonians.[25] As early as the 7th century BC Illyrian raids against Argead Macedonia inevitably also involved the Upper Macedonian regions of Lynkestis, Orestis, Eordaea, Elimea and Tymphaea, because they were located between Illyrian territory and the lands of the Argeads, who were based at Aegae.[27]
Lynkestian kingdom[edit]
Lynkestis was originally an autonomous kingdom in the region of Upper Macedonia.[25] It remained outside the region of power of the Macedonian Argead kings[28] until Philip's conquest in 358 BC.[29] About mid 5th century BC a royal dynasty claiming descent from aristocratic Bacchiad exiles from Corinth, who went to Lynkestis through Corcyra and Illyria, established itself ruling over Lynkestian Macedonians.[18] The kings of Lynkestis were Greek-speaking.[30] In the second half of the 5th century BC Lynkestis was the strongest tribal state in Upper Macedonia under Bomerus' son Arrhabeus,[31] who was the first attested Lynkestian ruler.[32]
 During the Peloponnesian War a coalition of Lyncestians and Illyrians won against a coalition of Macedon and Sparta at the Battle of Lyncestis in 423 BC.
A nominal confederacy between Lynkestis and the Upper Macedonian regions of Elimeia, Orestis and Pelagonia as well as Lower Macedonia (Pieria and Bottiaea) was created during the reign of Alexander I of Macedon (c. 495-454 B.C.).[33] Arrhabaeus entered into conflict with Perdiccas II of Macedon.[34] During the Peloponnesian War, a coalition of Lynkestians under Arrhabaeus and Illyrians defeated the joined forces of the Macedonian king Perdiccas II, who had wanted to invade Lynkestis, and the Spartan leader Brasidas, at the Battle of Lyncestis in 423 BC.[35] Besides Brasidas' forces, Perdiccas' faction was supported by Chalcidians, however the campaign against Lynkestis was a disaster because of Macedonian incompetence, resulting in the end of Brasidas' alliance with Perdiccas.[36] A pacification between Arrhabaeus and Perdiccas was started by Athenians. Perdiccas was interested in peace with Lynkestis due to his recent defeat in the Lynkestian campaign, the Lynkestian-Illyrian collaboration, and his new enmity with Brasidas. On the other hand Arrhabaeus was interested in peace with the Argeads to avert future invasions of his realm by Macedon.[37]
In 413 Perdiccas's son Archelaus obtained the throne of Macedon, and he evidently continued his father's conflict against the Lynkestians, probably involving Illyrians. The Macedonian king undertook a war against the Lynkestian Arrhabaeus and his Illyrian or Lynkestian-Illyrian ally, Sirras. Seeking help from the king of Elimeia, the marriage of Archelaus' eldest daughter with the king of Elimeia ensured a solid Upper Macedonian ally for Archelaus' war against Arrhabaeus and Sirras.[38] Additionally, Archelaus made general ameliorations to the military and reinforced the borders of his kingdom,[39] which apparently held the Illyrians momentarily at bay.[40]
The Illyrians (or an Illyrian-Lynkestian coalition) under king Bardylis invaded Macedon in 393 BC,[41] reaching Lower Macedonia as far as the Thermaic Gulf.[42] They expelled the Macedonian king Amyntas III out of Macedonia, and a puppet king, Argaeus II, who may have been a Lynkestian ruler,[43] was appointed to the throne of Macedon.[44] After two years, with the aid of Thessalians, Amyntas retook the throne of Macedon. Another possible Illyrian invasion of Macedon occurred around mid 380s. Amyntas retained his throne, but had to pay tribute to Bardylis.[45] 
After Bardylis' victory against Perdiccas III of Macedon in 360 BC Lynkestis was annexed or retained by the Illyrian king.[46][15][16]
Macedonian rule[edit]
 Map of the Kingdom of Macedon with Lynkestis (Lynkos) located in the western districts of the kingdom after Philip II's expansion in 358 BC.
After his ascension to the throne of Macedon Philip II wanted the total end of Illyrian influence in Upper Macedonia.[47] In 359 BC, negotiations took place between Bardylis and Philip II of Macedon, following the latter's ascension to the throne that year. In the negotiations, Bardylis demanded, and Philip refused, the continuing occupation of "Macedonian poleis" (i.e., Lynkestian strongholds). In 358 BC Philip mounted a major invasion of Illyrian-held territory, and decisively defeated the Illyrians under Bardylis in the Battle of Erigon Valley in 358 BC.[48] Philip's victories against the Illyrians in 358 BC overturned decades of Illyrian domination upon Macedonia,[49] and he was able to unite Upper and Lower Macedonia for the first time in the history of those regions.[47][50] After his victory, Philip II is said to have subdued all the area as far as Lake Ohrid, northwest of the Prespa Lakes region in Deuriopus. Soon after his victory in 358 BC Lynkestis, Pelagonia, Orestis and Tymphaea, were incorporated into Philip's greater Macedonia.[51] In the same year, Philip founded Heraclea Lyncestis, which would go on to become the chief city of the region until Late Antiquity.
Lynkestian dynasty[edit]
Lynkestian king Arrhabaeus who ruled in the second half of the 5th century BC was the son of Bomerus.[52] According to Strabo, Irra was the daughter of Arrhabaeus, and his granddaughter was Eurydice, the mother of Philip II.[53] Amyntas, one of the commanders sent by Philip II to defeat some of the Greek cities in Asia Minor, was a son of the Lynkestian king Arrhabaeus.[54]
Aeropus of Lynkestis, who was exiled by Philip II when he suspected him of treason, had three sons: Arrhabaeus, Heromenes, and Alexander.[55]

Early life[edit]
Merediz was born in Guantánamo, Cuba on February 15, 1956.[1][2] She left Cuba with her family when she was five years old to Miami, Florida.[5] Thereafter, she relocated with her family to Puerto Rico where she grew up.[5] Merediz graduated with a bachelor's degree from Newcomb College, the former female counterpart to Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana.[5]
Career[edit]
Film and television[edit]
Having made her film debut in 1984's The Brother from Another Planet, Merediz has since appeared in a number of films, including The Milagro Beanfield War (1988), City of Hope (1991), Evita (1996), Music of the Heart (1999), K-Pax (2001), Remember Me (2010), Custody (2016), Humor Me (2017), and the reprise of her 2008 Tony Award nominated Broadway role as Abuela Claudia, in the film adaptation In the Heights (2021). She also portrayed Alma Madrigal in Encanto (2021). 
Her television credits, in both dramas and comedies, include recurring and guest roles in Diary of a Future President, New Amsterdam, Brooklyn Nine-Nine, Orange Is the New Black and Madam Secretary. She has been a series regular in the UK television series Bounty Hunters and the comedy Saint George, has appeared in episodes of both Law & Order and Law & Order: SVU, and appeared as herself as a judge on Throwdown with Bobby Flay.
Theatre and stage[edit]
In addition to In the Heights, her Broadway credits include Reckless at the Manhattan Theatre Club, Man of La Mancha, and Les Misérables. She also appeared as Rosie in Mamma Mia!.
Before they went to Broadway, Merediz starred in the Off-Broadway versions of In the Heights, and The Human Comedy. Some of her other Off-Broadway credits include Women without Men, The Haggadah, Lullabye and Goodnight, and The Blessing.
Additionally, Merediz was directed by John Cassavetes in a play called Thornhill.
Voice-over credits[edit]
Merediz has an extensive voice-over and narration portfolio, including the PBS Nature documentaries: Bears,[6] Hotel Armadillo,[7] Jungle Animal Hospital,[8] Nature's Miracle Orphans,[9] and Cuba: The Accidental Eden.[10] Her voice can be heard in numerous TV/radio commercials, Dora the Explorer, Go, Diego, Go!, Elena of Avalor, and Encanto.
She served as spokesperson for the MTA, New York City Transit Authority.[11]
Awards and nominations[edit]
At the 2008 Tony Awards, she received a nomination for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Musical for the Broadway incarnation of In the Heights.[12] In addition to her Tony Award nomination, Merediz won a 2007 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance for her role in the off-Broadway run of In the Heights, as well as a 2003 HOLA Tespis Award from the Hispanic Organization of Latin Actors.[13]
In 2013, Latina magazine named her as one of the 50 Best Latin Singers and Pop Stars of All Time. According to the magazine, "The Cuban Broadway star knows how to dominate a live stage and owns it!"[14]

Charles ChampionBorn (1955-11-21) 21 November 1955 (age 66)Fontenay-sous-Bois, FranceNationalityFrenchEducationLycée CharlemagneAlma materSupaéroStanford UniversityOccupationBusinesspeople
Charles Champion (born 1955 near Paris), who holds a MSc from Stanford University, has been Airbus Executive Vice President Engineering since 1 April 2010 and a member of the Airbus Executive Committee.
After a 1978 graduation from the École nationale supérieure de l'aéronautique et de l'espace in Toulouse, he obtained a MSc from Stanford University.[1]
Champion began his aviation career in 1980 as an aerodynamics engineer with Aérospatiale, where he worked in the production department of the aircraft division before heading the single-aisle aircraft assembly team from 1988 to 1992.
In 1993 he was appointed Director of Airbus Programmes at Aérospatiale's Paris headquarters, and in 1995 became managing director of the military transport project named Future Large Aircraft or A400M.
In 1997, Champion joined Airbus as Vice President Sales for Eastern and Southern Europe and the CIS. From 1999 to 2000, he served as Product Executive for Airbus Single Aisle Programme. He also served as programme manager for the development of the Airbus A380 until he was removed in 2006 following controversy surrounding successive delays and cost overruns with the A380 program.
In 2007, he was appointed Executive Vice President in charge of Customer Services. This was a post he held until April 2010, when he became Executive Vice President Engineering in April 2010. In 2013 he was appointed Chairman, Airbus India, a subsidiary of Airbus.[2]

Area overview[edit]
The map alongside shows the Khatra subdivision of Bankura district. Physiographically, this area is having uneven lands with hard rocks. In the Khatra CD block area there are some low hills. The Kangsabati project reservoir is prominently visible in the map. The subdued patches of shaded area in the map show forested areas[1] It is an almost fully rural area.[2]
Note: The map alongside presents some of the notable locations in the subdivision. All places marked in the map are linked in the larger full screen map.
Kangsabati project[edit]
 Mukutmanipur Dam
In 1956, a giant water dam reservoir was planned at Mukutmanipur, [about 12 km from Khatra town in the district of Bankura, WB], under a big vision mooted by the then CM of Bengal Dr Bidhan Ch. Roy.  The Mukutmanipur dam was planned to provide major irrigation facilities to 8,000 square kilometres of agricultural land, stretched across Bankura, Purulia, Paschim Medinipur and parts of upper Hooghly.[3] Approximately two kilometres from the lake is the Bangopalpur Reserve Forest, a home of many species of flora and fauna.

Notable attractions[edit]
Approximately two kilometers from the lake is the Bangopalpur Reserve Forest, a home of many species of flora and fauna. Four kilometres from the dam is the ancient town of Ambikanagar, once an important place of pilgrimage for Jains.[4] However, a flood destroyed most of what remained in 1898.[5]
Mukutmanipur is home to a 10.8 km-long man-made mud-banked fresh water barrage. It canalises Kangshabati and Kumari rivers into the three drought affected districts of Bankura, Purulia and Midnapore for irrigation in the summer months.
Demographics[edit]
As per 2011 Census of India Mukutmanipur had a total population of 447 of which 240 (54%) were males and 207 (46%) were females. Population below 6 years was 40. The total number of literates in Mukutmanipur was 328 (80.59% of the population over 6 years).[6]

The Open Wireless Movement hosted at OpenWireless.org is an Internet activism project which seeks to increase Internet access by encouraging people and organizations to configure or install software on their own wireless router to offer a separate public guest network or to make a single public wireless access point. If many people did this, then a ubiquitous global public wireless network would be created which would achieve and surpass the goal of increasing Internet access.

History[edit]
The project was initiated in November 2012 by a coalition of ten advocacy groups including the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Fight for the Future, Free Press, Internet Archive, NYCwireless, Open Garden, OpenITP, the Open Spectrum Alliance, the Open Technology Institute, and the Personal Telco Project.[1] EFF representative Adi Kamdar commented, "We envision a world where sharing one's Internet connection is the norm. A world of open wireless would encourage privacy, promote innovation, and largely benefit the public good. And everyone—users, businesses, developers, and Internet service providers—can get involved."[1] As of September 2016, seventeen groups have joined the project, adding Engine, Mozilla, Noisebridge, the Open Rights Group, OpenMedia International, Sudo Room, and the Center for Media Justice.
The project uses various strategies to encourage and assist people to make their Internet connections available for public use. It explains the benefits and drawbacks of the effects on society and on the owners of routers, answers questions regarding safety and legality, guides novice users in configuring their routers, and provides firmware for novices to install on their routers.
Router[edit]
The EFF created a router firmware called OpenWireless, a fork of CeroWRT,[2] which is a branch of the OpenWrt firmware.[3] which anyone may volunteer to install on their router to make it work for the OpenWireless.org project.[4][5][6][7] This firmware was first shared at the 2014 Hackers on Planet Earth conference.[6] Its developers set out to achieve simple installation on a wide range of hardware routers but struggled with the diversity of closed, proprietary devices, and development of the OpenWireless firmware ended in April 2015 and was merged into Linux kernel and OpenWRT, openwireless.org redirects to eff.org.[5][8]
"In particular, once we obtained our first field data on router prevalence, we saw that none of the router models we expected to be able to support well have market shares above around 0.1%. Though we anticipated a fragmented market, that extreme degree of router diversity means that we would need to support dozens of different hardware platforms in order to be available to any significant number of users, and that does not seem to be an efficient path to pursue. Without a good path to direct deployment, EFF is deprioritizing our work on the freestanding router firmware project."[9]

Artificial creation is a field of research that studies the primary synthesis of complex lifelike structures from primordial lifeless origins.  
The field bears some similarity to artificial life, but unlike artificial life, artificial creation focuses on the primary emergence of complex structures and processes of abiogenesis.  Artificial creation does not rely exclusively on the application of evolutionary computation and genetic algorithms to optimize artificial creatures or grow synthetic life forms.  Artificial creation instead studies systems of rules of interaction, initial conditions and  primordial building blocks that can generate complex lifelike structures, based exclusively on repeated application of rules of interaction.
An essential difference that distinguishes artificial creation from other related fields is that no explicit fitness function is used to select for fit structures. Structures exist based only on their ability to persist as entities that do not violate the system's rules of interaction. Artificial creation studies the way in which complex emergent properties can arise to form a self-organizing system.

Origins[edit]
Although concepts and elements of artificial creation are represented to some degree in many areas, the field itself is less than a decade old. There are models of self-organizing systems that produce emergent properties in biology, computer science, mathematics, engineering and other fields. Artificial creation differs from these in that it focuses on underlying properties of systems that can generate the endless environmentally interactive complexity of living systems.  
One of the primary impetuses for the exploration of artificial creation comes from the realization in the artificial life and evolutionary computing fields that some basic assumptions common in these fields represent subtle mischaracterizations of natural evolution.  These fall into two general classes: 1) there are fundamental problems with the use of fitness functions for the primary synthesis of complex systems, and 2)  the process of self-replication used in almost all artificial life research is not a fundamental property of self-organizing systems.
Issues[edit]
The concept of a fitness function (or objective function) is central to artificial life systems. The fitness function is used to drive a given artificial evolution process to create synthetic organisms capable of performing a given task.  However, fitness functions, even aggregate high-level ones, drive evolving systems to particular solutions and place a ceiling on innovation and complexity.  Natural evolution does not drive organisms toward particular solutions to problems.  There is no motive force for evolution in our universe beyond that of adherence to physical law.  This is a subtle point: when modern organisms are viewed in a local context it does appear that they are evolving to optimize particular abilities that will help them survive.  This is not the case in a global sense.  In fact, the pressure to optimize a given ability comes from the current state of a given population.  The only fundamental selective pressure is the ability of structures to adhere to physical law.  Stochastic events initiated the appearance of features that we might view as adaptive traits, and it is the local evolution of these traits that much of evolutionary theory is based upon.  
The universe maintains its own consistency.  However, when trying to model the universe, or create artificial organisms by mimicking natural evolution, the application of fitness functions that select for particular abilities force an unnatural bias onto the evolving organisms. 
In evolutionary biology, it is well understood that all properties of organisms and ecosystems are emergent properties of fundamental physical law. The conceptual problems related to generations, offspring and populations that occur in artificial life systems stem from the fact that self-replication is itself an innovation of life on Earth.  The dynamics observed in modern self-replicating life forms on Earth are extremely complex emergent properties of the organisms themselves, not driving forces imposed by an external controlling entity.

Content[edit]
In the original Greek according to Westcott-Hort, this verse is:
Ὅσοι δὲ ἔλαβον αὐτόν, ἔδωκεν αὐτοῖς ἐξουσίαν τέκνα Θεοῦ γενέσθαι, τοῖς πιστεύουσιν εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ·
In the King James Version of the Bible the text reads:
But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
The New International Version translates the passage as:
Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.
Analysis[edit]
Lapide comments on the phrase "on Him", as signifying the Person of Christ, and that the full meaning is "as many as have received Christ, that is, to all who believe in His name, He has given power to become sons of God," which has the same sense as (1 John 5:1): "Whosoever believes that Jesus is the Christ, is born of God."[1]
Commentary from the Church Fathers[edit]
Augustine: "But if none at all received, none will be saved. For no one will he saved, but he who received Christ at His coming; and therefore he adds, As many as received Him."[2]
Chrysostom: "Whether they be bond or free, Greek or Barbarian, wise or unwise, women or men, the young or the aged, all are made meet for the honour, which the Evangelist now proceeds to mention. To them gave He power to become the sons of God."[2]
Augustine: "O amazing goodness! He was born the Only Son, yet would not remain so; but grudged not to admit joint heirs to His inheritance. Nor was this narrowed by many partaking of it."[2]
Chrysostom: "He saith not that He made them the sons of God, but gave them power to become the sons of God: showing that there is need of much care, to preserve the image, which is formed by our adoption in Baptism, untarnished: and showing at the same time also that no one can take this power from us, except we rob ourselves of it. Now, if the delegates of worldly governments have often nearly as much power as those governments themselves, much more is this the case with us, who derive our dignity from God. But at the same time the Evangelist wishes to show that this grace comes to us of our own will and endeavour: that, in short, the operation of grace being supposed, it is in the power of our free will to make us the sons of God."[2]
Theophylact of Ohrid: "Or the meaning is, that the most perfect sonship will only be attained at the resurrection, as saith the Apostle, Waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body. (Rom. 8:23) He therefore gave us the power to become the sons of God, i. e. the power of obtaining this grace at some future time."[2]
Chrysostom: "And because in the matter of these ineffable benefits, the giving of grace belongs to God, but the extending of faith to man, He subjoins, even to those who believe on his name. Why then declarest thou not, John, the punishment of those who received Him not? Is it because there is no greater punishment than that, when the power of becoming the sons of God is offered to men, they should not become such, but voluntarily deprive themselves of the dignity? But besides this, inextinguishable fire awaits all such, as will appear clearly farther on."[2]

The Rheinland-Pfälzische Personendatenbank (People database of Rhineland-Palatinate, RPPD) is an internet database with short biographies of people who have lived or worked in Rhineland-Palatinate. It is being edited at four scientific libraries in Rhineland-Palatinate: Rheinische Landesbibliothek Koblenz, Pfälzische Landesbibliothek Speyer, Stadtbibliothek Mainz, Stadtbibliothek Trier. The RPPD is hosted by Rheinische Landesbibliothek Koblenz, a facility of the Landesbibliothekszentrums Rheinland-Pfalz.

Content[edit]
Research for the Rheinland-Pfälzische Bibliographie often results also in biographical data. In 2005 this developed into the idea for a separate database.
Criteria[edit]
The criterion for an entry is that a person was born on the territory of today's Rhineland-Palatinate (also before the establishment of the Bundesland in 1946) or has died there or has done some significant work there. Currently (April 2013) around 10,000 people from Roman times onwards are recorded. With authorization by the rights owners data from printed biographical reference works were added.[1] As far as dead people are concerned, the name registers have been integrated into the biography portal in March 2012.[2] A dataset includes the following information (if ascertainable): name forms, sex, life dates, places of life and work, occupations, fields of expertise, relations to other persons (inside and outside of the RPPD), own works, sources, biographical text. All this information can also be researched.

Sohail Castle (Spanish: Castillo Sohail) is a castle in Fuengirola, Spain.
It was built in AD 956 by Abd-ar-Rahman III to strengthen the coastal defenses.[1] In 2000 the Town of Fuengirola renovated the ruins of the castle turning it into a tourist attraction and functioning space used for concerts and other festivals. Excavated stone ruins on public display at the western base of the hill on which the castle sits are dated back to before the Roman Republic occupied Fuengirola at least 300 BC.

Chemical compound
Di-tert-butyl-iminodicarboxylate is an organic compound that can be described with the formula [(CH3)3COC(O)]2NH. It is a white solid that is soluble in organic solvents. The compound is used as a reagent for the preparation of primary amines from alkyl halides.[1] It was popularized as an alternative to the Gabriel synthesis for the same conversion. Amines can also be prepared from alcohols by dehydration using the Mitsunobu reaction.[2]
In the usual implementation the reagent is deprotonated to give the potassium salt, which is N-alkylated. The Boc protecting groups are subsequently removed under acidic conditions.

March of Turin
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The March or Marquisate of Turin (Italian: marca di Torino) was a territory of medieval Italy from the mid-10th century, when it was established as the Arduinic March (Latin: marca Arduinica). It comprised several counties in Piedmont, including the counties of Turin, Auriate, Albenga and, probably, Ventimiglia.[n 1] The confines of the march thus stretched across the Po Valley from the Western Alps in the north, to the Ligurian Sea.
Because of the later importance of the city and valley of Susa to the House of Savoy, whose members styled themselves as "marquises of Susa", the march is sometimes referred to as the March or Marquisate of Susa. Yet in the tenth and early eleventh centuries, the city and valley of Susa were not the most important part of the county, let alone the march, of Turin. Successive members of the Arduinici dynasty were documented far more frequently in their capital, the city of Turin, than anywhere else, and until the late 1020s, Susa was controlled by a cadet branch of the dynasty, rather than by the marquises themselves.[2]

History[edit]
The march was formed by a reorganisation of the territory of the kingdom of Italy into three marches, named after their three ruling dynasties:[3]
the Marca Arduinica, or mark of the Arduinici (created in 964)
the Marca Aleramica, or mark of the Aleramici (created in 967)
the Marca Obertenga or mark of the Obertenghi (created in 961)
Arduin Glaber was invested as count of Turin in 941 by Hugh of Italy. Arduin had captured Turin and the Susa Valley from the Saracens.[4] In 964, Arduin was appointed margrave of Turin by Emperor Otto I.[5] The march continued to be ruled by members of the Arduinici thereafter. Arduin Glaber's son Manfred I succeeded him and his son, Ulric Manfred II, succeeded him. Ulric had no son, so he left the march to his daughter Adelaide.[6] Although Adelaide ruled in her own right, de jure control passed to her husband Otto, count of Aosta. Their descendants would later comprise the House of Savoy. Gundulph, the father of St Anselm, may have represented a collateral branch of Manfred's dynasty.[7]
After Adelaide’s death in 1091, the march of Turin broke up. Comital authority in the city of Turin was invested in the bishop of Turin (1092) and the city itself became a commune (1091). 
In 1092, the emperor Henry IV appointed his son Conrad as margrave of Turin (Conrad was Adelaide’s grandson via her daughter Bertha of Savoy).[8] Although Conrad attempted to gain control of the march, his power was never effectual and the title was largely nominal.[9] Instead, the northern part of the march of Turin was absorbed into Savoy, which was ruled by another of Adelaide’s grandsons, Humbert II (many centuries later, Turin became the capital of this dynasty.) To the south, lands which had composed the march of Turin were annexed by Adelaide's nephew, Boniface del Vasto.[9]
List of Margraves of Turin[edit]

962–977 Arduin Glaber
977–1000 Manfred I
1000–1034 Ulric Manfred II
1034–1091 Adelaide, de facto ruler, with her husbands, sons and grandson-in-law.
House of Babenberg[edit]
1037–1038 Herman IV, Duke of Swabia (Adelaide's first husband)
Aleramici[edit]
1041–1045 Henry, Margrave of Montferrat (Adelaide's second husband)
House of Savoy[edit]
1046–1060 Otto, Count of Savoy (Adelaide's third husband)
1060–1078 Peter I, Count of Savoy (Adelaide's son)
1078–1080 Amadeus II, Count of Savoy (Adelaide's son)
House of Montbéliard[edit]
1080–1091 Frederick of Montbéliard (Adelaide's grandson-in-law)
The title Marquis of Turin was later used by Prince Vittorio Emanuele of Savoy, a member of the house of Savoy which ruled Italy from 1861 and 1946.

Production[edit]
Salman Khan announced the film in 2017. He also confirmed via Twitter that the film would star his brother-in-law Aayush Sharma and would be directed by Abhiraj Minawala.[5] Abhiraj was Ali Abbas Zafar's assistant director for Sultan and Tiger Zinda Hai. In February 2018, Salman announced that Warina Hussain would be the leading lady of the film.[6] The film is the Bollywood debut for both Aayush and Warina. Loveyatri is a romantic drama set against the backdrop of Navratri in Gujarat.[7] Aayush stars as a Garba teacher from Baroda, who falls in love with an NRI, played by Warina, when she visits the town during the festival.[8]
The film was shot in two schedules. Several scenes were also shot in Vadodara in March 2018. This was followed by the second half starting in April 2018 in London. Principal photography completed in June 2018.[9]

Controversy[edit]
A minor dispute emerged during the middle of promotions, in late September 2018, regarding the film's name.[11] It was originally titled Loveratri, which is a play on the words "love" and "Navratri" (a religious 9 day celebration of the Hindu goddess Durga). However, the religious organisation Vishva Hindu Parishad felt that the title distorted the meaning of the festival and filed a complaint against the producers. A court in Bihar asked the police to file a First Information Report against the actor Salman Khan and the rest of the film's cast. On 18 September 2018, Khan announced on his Instagram page that the film's title would be changed from Loveratri to Loveyatri, with "yatri" meaning "traveller", thus changing the overall meaning approximately to "the journey of love".[12]
However, the following day a Gujarat-based Hindu organization, Sanatan Foundation, legally filed a Public Interest Litigation move against the new name, claiming that it still sounded too similar to "Navratri". They sought another name change (possibly to "Love Ki Yatra"), changing the film's content, or to ban the film entirely for "hurting the sentiments of Hindus".[13]
On 27 September 2018, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the film's producers, stating that "no coercive action is to be taken in any part of the country against Salman Khan Ventures Pvt ltd."[14] The ruling was submitted considering the film's status as having been cleared by the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), and yet had an FIR registered in Bihar against it and a criminal complaint pending in Vadodara, Gujarat.  The statement concluded by asserting that any further complaints, particularly those related to the contents or name of the film, would not be entertained.[15]

Intruder is an American thrash metal band from Nashville, Tennessee. Formerly known as "Transgresser", the group began as a four-piece cover band.[2] They saw the addition of rhythm guitarist Greg Messick after signing with Metal Blade Records.
Intruder released three full-length albums and one EP from 1987 to 1991 before splitting up in 1992. Since then, the band has reunited several times to play live shows.[3]

History[edit]
The band was originally formed in 1984 under the name "Transgresser". They released demos in 1984 and 1986 (which would later appear on a re-release of their debut album). After going through several name changes they became known as "Intruder". They released their debut album Live to Die in 1987 as a four-piece band in the speed metal vein.
The band signed with Metal Blade Records in 1989. The Metal Blade years saw the entry of rhythm guitarist Greg Messick. Intruder released their second album, A Higher Form of Killing, in 1989 as a five-piece band. It presented a move away from speed metal to the thrash metal scene. Intruder released the very rare Escape from Pain EP in 1990. Admittedly released as "an excuse to tour", it featured songs recorded on previous releases as well as a cover of "25 or 6 to 4" by Chicago.[4] It featured just one new song, the title track. Escape from Pain was the only one of their Metal Blade releases not to be issued on the three formats of CD, cassette and vinyl.
In 1991 Intruder released their final full-length album Psycho Savant. It was their only Metal Blade release to feature all original songs. After five years of releases and touring, the group disbanded in 1992. In a 2006 interview, Guitarist Greg Messick claimed that the band tried to stay together after being dropped from Metal Blade, but were ultimately unwilling due to inevitable lineup changes. Vocalist Jimmy Hamilton responded to the question of the band's split up in the same interview:
We got dropped from Metal Blade in the middle of our tour when we just hit the charts. Besides, although we had been together for so long, just like many marriage relationships there was no more 'love' and we said 'this marriage needs to end for a while. We need counseling'.— Jimmy Hamilton[5]
Intruder did an impressive amount of touring during their short career. Although very little was done in the way of promotion, Intruder was able to tour for each release in the US, Canada and Mexico and shared stages with the likes of Helstar, Anvil and Morbid Angel. Since 2002, the group has reunited from time to time. They performed at the Classic Metal Fest in Ohio, 2002, and had a headlining spot at the Headbangers Open Air in Germany. They also played the Keep It True festival in Germany in 2007 and a reunion show in their home town of Nashville in November 2011, in honor of the 20th anniversary of Psycho Savant.[6]
In 2004, the band re-released their 1987 debut album Live to Die through Hellion Records with six bonus tracks.
They are presently in the studio working on a 'Best Of' CD which will consist of eight fan-picked tracks from the two Metal Blade Records releases, A Higher Form of Killing and Psycho Savant. It will also contain a brand new track as well. This release sees the return of Todd Nelson on bass. This will be the first time the original Metal Blade lineup will have recorded together since 1991.
2017 was the 30th anniversary of the band.
After a few years on hiatus, Intruder announced a reunion on their Facebook page on October 16, 2019, and that they were planning to play some shows in 2020, including that year's Headbangers Open Air.[7]
Longtime rhythm guitarist Greg Messick died unexpectedly on September 5, 2020, at the age of 55; his death was announced by the band that same day.[8][9][10]

They lived through the Ming and Qing dynasties and still live in Dezhou today.[by whom?][citation needed]
The Kingdom of Sulu was converted to Islam, and the Hashemite Sharif ul-Hāshim of Sulu arrived in Sulu and married a princess of the previous non-Hashemite royal family, founding the Sulu Sultanate.[citation needed]
Tausug delegations from Sulu have visited Dezhou to see the descendants of the previous royal family.[citation needed]

Transport[edit]
Historical[edit]
The Yellow river and the Grand Canal runs through Dezhou, making it an important hub for cargo transit since antient times. It was described as "Junction of Nine Arteries" (九达天衢) and "Portal of the Capital" (神京门户).
Modern Era[edit]
Dezhou is connected via the Shijiazhuang-Dezhou railway, Shijiazhuang-Ji'nan HSR, Beijing-Shanghai railway, Beijing-Shanghai HSR. A small, single-track railway connects Dezhou with Dongying city as well.
The main expressway passing Dezhou is the G3 Beijing-Taipei Expressway, running north–south from it; other provincial expressways, as well as National Highway 104 and 105 offer connections in other directions for Dezhou
Tourism[edit]
Main article: Tourism in the People's Republic of China
Dezhou's biggest historical attraction is the tomb of Sultan Paduka Pahala of Sulu (Philippines), who died in Dezhou on his return journey from a visit to the Yongle Emperor in 1417.[2] The tomb is well preserved and has been declared a national heritage site. Descendants of the sultan's Muslim followers still live in Dezhou today, and are classified as the Hui minority.
One of Dezhou's county Lingxian used to be a big county in China in history, when it was called Pingyuan County. Now part of the ancient city wall of Tang Dynasty still exists in the south of the region. Before the Three Kingdoms formed, one of the three emperors Liu Bei used to be the chief of the county, together with his fellows Guan Yu and Zhang Fei. In addition, it is the hometown of Dongfang Shuo, the most well-known adviser during the reign of Emperor Wu of Han ; In Tang Dynasty, a major figure of Chinese calligraphy, Yan Zhenqing, once took office as the administrator of the county. Today, a memorial hall for the two historic figures is built in the People's Park of Lingxian, where a lot of materials of Dongfang Shuo and stone inscriptions of Yan Zhenqing are preserved.
For tourist attractions, there is also a famous temple in Qingyun County. It's called Haidao Jinshan Temple, which is one of the biggest centers of Buddhism in Northern China. The most attractive scene is the underground aisle where the portrait of the hell is presented using high technology.
Industry[edit]
A new industrial zone hailed as the "Solar Valley" is being built for experimenting with clean-energy urban projects and massive use of household utilities such as solar-powered water-heaters. The Washington Post describes Dezhou's Solar Valley as the "clean-tech version of Silicon Valley".[7]
Nowadays one of the biggest and most famous industries in Dezhou is solar energy industry, with two main corporations included—Himin Group (皇明集团) and its partner Ecco Solar Group (亿家能集团). Dezhou increased its international reputation when it was selected to follow previous hosts,[8] Daegu, South Korea (2004), Oxford, UK (2006) and Adelaide, Australia (2008) as host of the 2010 International Solar City Congress.[9] Himin Group has developed into the world's largest solar water heater manufacturer and is also discovering new areas such as photoelectricity.
Greenpeace China cited Dezhou in May 2009 as an example of how renewable energy can become a more common reality throughout the world.[10]
Dezhou also houses the world's largest solar-powered office building, covering around 75,000 square meters.[11][12]
Education[edit]
"Dezhou University"(also called Dezhou College, because it only offers undergraduate degree) is a comprehensive college which was approved by the National Education Committee in March 2000. It is the aggregation of Dezhou Teachers’ College, Dezhou Education College and Evening College Municipality, which has a 30-year history.

Early life[edit]
Andrea Catherwood was born and raised in Belfast where her mother, Adrienne McGuill, was an announcer and newsreader at Ulster Television, from 1959 to 1969 and also presented The Romper Room from 1964 to 1969 as Miss Adrienne.  Adrienne Catherwood was appointed an MBE in 2004 for her work with the charity Action Medical Research. Andrea was educated at Strathearn School in Belfast. Her broadcasting career began aged 16 when she joined the BBC in Belfast as a co-presenter of a youth current affairs programme, for which she won BBC Northern Ireland's Young Presenter of the Year award. The following year she co-presented the youth current affairs programme Up Front. Aged 18, Catherwood made a documentary for BBC Radio 4 about the 18 years of troubles in Northern Ireland.
Journalism career[edit]
Following an honours degree in law from the University of Manchester, in 1990 Catherwood joined Ulster Television, where she spent three years as a news and features reporter. In 1993 she joined NBC Asia in Hong Kong as a news reporter, covering the handover of Hong Kong to China and the 1997 stock-market turmoil. She travelled extensively throughout Asia, and in Burma interviewed opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi.
She joined ITN in April 1998 starting as newscaster and senior reporter for ITV News, presenting the ITV Morning News and providing special reports for News at Ten. She then became medical correspondent for ITV News. Having joined Five News in 2000 as a main news presenter, she moved back to ITV in 2001.
In November 2001 she was the first British journalist into Mazari Sharif after the Northern Alliance captured the city from Taliban forces. She produced a number of reports, which received wide coverage in the British press. Catherwood was reporting from inside the prison at the beginning of the Taliban prisoners uprising when one exploded a concealed grenade that killed five people. Catherwood was injured in the knee by shrapnel.
In 2003, she was promoted and made the main anchor of the ITV Weekend News, plus a relief presenter on the ITV Lunchtime News and ITV Evening News.
Catherwood left ITV News in September 2006, to front The Sunday Edition, ITV's new political show with Andrew Rawnsley. However, this was quietly dropped in November 2007.[1]
In 2006, she was scheduled to appear on the celebrity special of The X Factor: Battle of the Stars and to sing with James Hewitt but ITV management refused to give her permission to appear on the show.[2] In 2007, she was a contestant on the ITV series Vernon Kay's Gameshow Marathon.
In July 2009, to coincide with the 40th anniversary of the NASA moon landings, ITN produced five special 10-minute programmes for ITV titled Mission to the Moon – News from 1969. Catherwood, a former ITN newscaster and correspondent, reported for these specials. The first aired at 22:35 on ITV on Wednesday 15 July and ran the following Thursday, Friday, Sunday and Monday.
In October 2009 Catherwood joined Bloomberg Television as part of the news station's relaunch, where she anchored Briefing, The Pulse, and Last Word.[3] She left in March 2012.[4]
Catherwood is now a weekly contributor to This Morning on ITV, as well as writing for The Mail on Sunday.
Over the past three years she has been a presenter on various Radio 4 programmes. She presented BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour,[5] as well as You and Yours, and is a regular stand-in presenter of the Media Show on Radio 4. In September 2017, she appeared on the BBC Radio  4 programme "Great Lives", nominating Constance Markievicz for a great life. As of December 2020 she still presents Woman's Hour occasionally; however her future participation is uncertain.
In October 2022, it was announced that Catherwood would present the new series of Feedback (radio series)!Feedback on BBC Radio 4; the programme holds the BBC to account by allowing the radio listeners to express their opinions.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Catherwood married lawyer Graham Smith on 3 July 2002 at a private family ceremony in Kenmare, in the west of Ireland.[7] The couple have three children.[8]

 Three Palace Sanctuaries in the Taishō Era in the 1920s
The Three Palace Sanctuaries (宮中三殿, Kyūchū sanden) are a group of structures in the precincts of the Tokyo Imperial Palace in Japan. They are used in imperial religious ceremonies, including weddings and enthronements. 
The three sanctuaries are:
Kashiko-dokoro (賢所) – the central shrine, enshrining a replica of the mirror Yata no Kagami, representing the mythological ancestress of the Imperial Family, Amaterasu. (For the enthronements in Kyoto of Emperor Taishō in 1915 and of Emperor Shōwa in 1928, the mirror was transported by special rolling stock known as the Kashiko-dokoro Jōgyosha (賢所乗御車) from the name of this sanctuary.) The Yasakani no magatama or Sacred Jewel, one of the Imperial Regalia of Japan, is also said to be housed in the Kashiko-dokoro.
Kōrei-den (皇霊殿) – the Ancestral Spirits Sanctuary, enshrining the departed spirits of the Imperial Family from one year after their death.
Shin-den (神殿) – the Sanctuary of the Kami, enshrining the Amatsukami (天津神) from Takamagahara and the Kunitsukami (国津神) from Japanese mythology.

Electra is a serif typeface designed by William Addison Dwiggins and published by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company from 1935 onwards. A book face intended for body text, Dwiggins described the design as intended to be a 'modern roman type letter' with 'personality', avoiding direct revival of any historical model. He therefore chose the name Electra to suggest electricity and crisp modernity, "like metal shavings coming off a lathe".[1][2][3]
After a slow development process, Electra became a popular book typeface in American printing during the late metal type period.[4] After an eclipse in popularity, partly due to poor translation of the design to modern printing technologies, several revivals have been released.

Background[edit]
 Electra with cursive
After establishing a career as a lettering artist and book designer, Dwiggins was hired as a consultant by the Mergenthaler Linotype Company in 1929 and established a partnership with its head of type design Chauncey H. Griffith, who would manage the production of all his typefaces for the rest of his career.[5] Dwiggins's first typeface was Metro, a sans-serif intended as an answer to new European faces such as Futura and Gill Sans, which were experiencing a vogue.
 Electra in metal type with its original oblique. A more conventional italic was later added.
After Metro, Dwiggins set out to design a serif book typeface for long-form reading. His stated intention was to avoid the historical revival approach of most contemporary book faces, which imitated type designs from the Renaissance. Dwiggins marketed the design with a whimsical brochure, Emblems and Electra, in which he claimed the design to be the result of communing with the spirit of Kōbō-Daishi, the Japanese monk famous as a calligrapher and educator.[1][6] Vincent Connare suggests that Electra's narrow, monoline serifs make it look somewhat similar to the typefaces of Pierre-Simon Fournier in the eighteenth century, and it is for this reason that it is generally classified as "transitional".[7] The swash tail of “Q” is also reminiscent of the types of John Baskerville.
In metal, Electra was offered with text figures and two different lengths of descenders; the longer of the two (favored by Dwiggins) required leading, while the shorter could be set solid.[3]
The original release of Electra did not include an italic, with Dwiggins instead choosing to offer an oblique in which the letterforms are slanted without taking on any handwriting characteristics; this was apparently influenced by the arguments of Stanley Morison, who promoted the idea as a more appropriate secondary type than a cursive italic. This did not prove popular, however, and Dwiggins designed a true italic, named "Electra Cursive", which was released in 1940.[4] From this point Electra became a popular book type in American printing: Walter Tracy described it as a "modern classic" in American bookwork, although he felt Dwiggins' italic, his first to be published as a type design, was awkwardly balanced in some characters.[4] In Britain, the war prevented Electra Cursive's release, and the typeface never attained the same popularity.[3]
Digital revivals and interpretations[edit]
Electra was digitized in 1994 by Alex Kaczun for Linotype and Adobe. Both a standard and display cut were produced in regular and boldface, although even the standard cut appears thin at typical text sizes (a common issue with early digitizations of metal type). This version uses the longer descenders from the metal version; the italic is Electra Cursive. Although for the most part an exact copy of the outlines of the metal type, the lowercase "f" is given a longer overhang, without the restrictions of the Linotype machine. The Linotype release features separate fonts for small caps and text figures, while the Adobe release incorporates these as OpenType features.[8][9]
Bitstream digitized Electra as Transitional 521; it is the most basic of the digital offerings, with only a basic Latin character set and few typographic features.[10] The italic, which uses Electra Cursive, is available only in the regular weight. A version of this design released by Tilde has a wider range of accented and special characters, but no additional weights or features.
Compugraphic’s cold type Electra copy, Elante, is available digitally from Monotype. It uses the shorter descenders from the metal version of Electra.
Jim Parkinson has created several fonts based on the original Electra:
An in-house typeface for the San Francisco Chronicle in the early 1990s, which came to be known as Electric; it was heavier than Electra and had shorter extenders.[11] Parkinson complemented it for headings with a digitisation of Dwiggins' sans-serif Metro.[12]
Azuza (2001),[13] which preserved the general proportions of Electric but added more refined details. Produced in three weights: light, medium, and bold, with italics based on Electra Cursive.
Parkinson Electra (2010), created for Linotype as an improvement over their original digital version. It is a freer interpretation than the 1992 version, featuring a heavier regular weight and more delicate serifs to improve its presence on the page. Produced in three weights: regular, bold, and heavy, all with italics based on Electra Cursive.[14]
Aluminia (2017), digitized from Dwiggins's original design drawings, with italics in both the original oblique roman and the later cursive. There is no boldface, mirroring the initial metal version. It was created expressly for the Letterform Archive for use in the retrospective W. A. Dwiggins: A Life in Design, and an in-progress version containing just the basic character set necessary for setting the book has been distributed to crowdfunding backers. However, there are plans for a limited commercial release once it is complete.[15]
Poets Electra is a custom digitization drawn by Christian Schwartz and Miguel Reyes of Commercial Type for the Academy of American Poets.[16] They chose to work from the 8-point metal type of Electra in response to the project's requirement of a font to be used on the World Wide Web, the accommodations in physical type for very small print sizes being similar to those in digital fonts for text sizes on screen.[17] A slightly heavier version, Poets Electra No. 2, was also produced for use in the academy's official printed matter.
Cyrus Highsmith has designed several newsfaces inspired by Dwiggins's work. Of these, Prensa (1999, for La Prensa Gráfica of El Salvador) is the most directly influenced by Electra. It features a particularly restrained italic reminiscent of Electra's original oblique, using cursive letterforms that nevertheless hew more closely to the roman than to handwriting.
See also[edit]
Joanna by Eric Gill, a design contemporaneous to Electra, born of the same impulse to create a book typeface balancing “humanity” and “modernity”, and with a similarly restrained italic
Romulus by Jan van Krimpen, another 1930s book serif typeface with a sloped roman “italic”. (A separate chancery italic, Cancelleresca Bastarda, is a part of the same series, but its much longer ascenders and descenders prevented it from being used as a companion italic.)

The 132nd brigade was reinforced by the 1st independent border guards unit and in turn assigned to 128th division with the start of the Soviet invasion of Manchuria 9 August 1945. Therefore, the top-level assignment of the 132nd brigade has changed to the 1st area army.
Action[edit]
On 9 August 1945, the Tungning detachment of the 132nd brigade beat off a direct Soviet attack at Dongning. Nonetheless, the rest of brigade was ordered to withdraw in the evening of the same day, with the left-behind forces outflanked and routed on 11 August 1945.
After retreating to Tachienchang, the 132nd brigade was merged with the remnants of the 284th infantry regiment from the 128th division to form a "Tachienchang detachment". It held its positions against some Red Army armoured units until 16 August 1945 before surrendering following the surrender of Japan.

McGowan picked up the sport of rugby during his junior year of high school at St. Thomas High School in Houston, Texas.[2] McGowan played for the U.S. national under-20 team for the 2012 IRB Junior World Rugby Trophy. McGowan played his college rugby at St. Mary's in California, where he was an All-American and led the team to the 2014 D1A national championship and 2015 D1A national championship.[3]

Annual rugby union competition in England
For the second tier of the English Counties competition, see Bill Beaumont County Championship Division 2. For the third tier of the English Counties competition, see Bill Beaumont County Championship Division 3.

The Championship is an annual rugby union competition in England between teams representing English counties.  After restructuring in 2007 the top tier of the Championship has been known as the Bill Beaumont Cup, after the trophy awarded to the competition winners was named in honour of Bill Beaumont, a former England and British & Irish Lions captain.[1]  In 2017 the competition was officially known as Bill Beaumont Division 1, with teams also competing in Division 2 and Division 3, which prior to 2017 were known as the Plate and Shield competitions.[2]
The Championship has a long history, being first officially recognised by the Rugby Football Union in 1889. The 2018 Championship was the 118th competition. The most successful county, Lancashire, has won the competition 25 times, followed by Gloucestershire (17) and Yorkshire (15). Lancashire (34) & Gloucestershire (33) have made the most appearances in contested finals.
On four occasions the tournament final has been tied at full-time and a second leg rematch has been played. Two of these rematches were also tied and on these occasions (1907 and 1967) the finalists were declared joint winners. In 1991 the final match between Cornwall and Yorkshire was tied at full-time and extra time was played, with Cornwall winning 29–20.
In 2001 the Championship did not take place due to the 2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak; instead Yorkshire and Cornwall were invited to play at Twickenham.
The 2015 final was contested by Lancashire and Cornwall, with the teams meeting in the final for the third consecutive year.[3] Cornwall won the championship with an 18-13 victory, their fourth title overall and their first since 1999.[4] Cornwall retained their title in 2016, this time beating Cheshire, 35–13.[5] In 2017 Cornwall and Lancashire met in the final for the fourth time in five seasons. Lancashire won 19-8 and prevented Cornwall from completing a hat-trick of county titles.[6]

Structure[edit]
There was little formal structure to the first official years of the competition, with teams playing different numbers of matches and different opposition from across England. The winners were determined by a panel of judges from the RFU Committee. From 1891–1895, the four winners of four regional Championships (North East, North West, South East and South West) played a round-robin tournament to determine the overall winner of the County Championship.
A restructure in 1896, led to the creation of North and South regions only, the winners of these regional competitions playing a final for the County Championship. Another restructure in 1921 saw the formation of five regions and the knock-out stage of the championship extend to semi-finals and a final. The winners of the North East, North West and South East regions were entered into a semi-final draw along with the winners of a play-off between the winners of the South and South West regions.
From 2007 to 2016, the top eight counties were split into two regions of four teams, North and South, who played a round-robin tournament. The winners of each region competed for the English County Championship in the final. This format was repeated for the eight counties that competed for the County Championship Plate. The eleven counties which competed for the County Championship Shield were split into three pools from which the winners and the runner-up with the best record met in semi-final matches.
In 2017 the competition was given a new structure, with the top tier comprising twelve teams and the second and third tiers having eight teams each. Each tier has a final each year, but promotion and relegation between tiers is decided on a two-year basis.[7]

Cumbria, a 1974 amalgamation of the former counties of Cumberland, Westmorland, and the Furness part of Lancashire, is shown separately from Cumberland and Lancashire.
Eastern Counties and Notts, Lincs & Derby have reached the final but have never won the championship.
Gloucestershire are the only county to have completed a "hat-trick of tat-trick" of  county titles: 1920,1921 & 1922; 1930,1931 & 1932; 1974,1975 & 1976.
John Fidler, former Gloucester, Gloucestershire and England lock forward, still holds the record for the most County Championship Final appearances, nine in all, from 1971 to 1984.

Design and development[edit]
The Lyulka TR-3A was redesignated as the AL-5 to honor Arkhip Mikhailovich Lyulka in 1950. It was a single-shaft turbojet with a seven-stage axial compressor. It had an annular combustion chamber with 24 nozzles and a single-stage turbine. It had a fixed exhaust nozzle and had a turbine starting unit.[1]
It was used in the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-350, but flamed out when it was throttled back on that aircraft's first flight on 16 June 1951. It was also flown in the Lavochkin La-190 in 1951, but suffered similar problems. The AL-5 was modified as the AL-5G in an attempt to rectify the flame-out problem, which also increased its thrust by 2 kN (450 lbf), and was successfully flown in the prototype Ilyushin Il-46 bomber during 1952, but was not placed into production when the Tupolev Tu-16 was ordered into production instead of the Il-46.[2]

English Dominican friar
Peter Atwood (1643–1712) was an English Dominican friar.
Atwood was a native of Warwickshire, joined the order in 1678, and was ordained priest five years later. He was several times cast into prison, and at length was condemned to death on account of his sacerdotal character. The hurdle was actually at the gate of the gaol to convey him to Tyburn when Charles II sent him a reprieve. Father Atwood, who governed his brethren as provincial from 1698 to 1706, died in London, 12 August 1712.

James Ambrose Johnson Jr. (February 1, 1948 – August 6, 2004), better known by his stage name Rick James, was an American singer-songwriter, musician and record producer. Born and raised in Buffalo, New York, James began his musical career in his teenage years. He was in various bands before entering the U.S. Navy Reserve to avoid being drafted into the army. In 1964, James deserted to Toronto, Canada, where he formed the rock band the Mynah Birds, who eventually signed a recording deal with Motown Records in 1966. James's career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted him of desertion related charges. He served several months in jail.  After being released, James moved to California, where he started a variety of rock and funk groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
After forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's Gordy Records, releasing the album Come Get It! in 1978 which produced the hits "You & I" and "Mary Jane". In 1981, James released his most successful album, Street Songs, which included career-defining hits such as "Give It to Me Baby" and "Super Freak", the latter song becoming his biggest crossover single, mixing elements of funk, disco, rock and new wave. James was also known for his soulful ballads such as "Fire & Desire" and "Ebony Eyes". In addition, James also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including Teena Marie, the Mary Jane Girls, the Temptations, Eddie Murphy and Smokey Robinson.
James's mainstream success had peaked by the release of his album Glow in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, The A-Team. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper MC Hammer sampled James's "Super Freak" for his 1990 hit, "U Can't Touch This" which won Best R&B Song at the 1991 Grammy Awards. James received his only Grammy for composing the song.[1] By the early 1990s, James's career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled with legal issues. In 1993, James was convicted for two separate instances of kidnapping and assaulting two different women while under the influence of crack cocaine, resulting in a three-year sentence at Folsom State Prison. James was released on parole in 1996 and released the album Urban Rapsody in 1997. James's health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.
In 2004, James's career returned to mainstream pop culture after he appeared in an episode of Chappelle's Show. The segment involved a Charlie Murphy True Hollywood Stories–style skit that satirized James's wild lifestyle in the 1980s. This resulted in renewed interest in his music and that year he returned to perform on the road. James died later that year from heart failure at age 56. 
In November 2020, James's estate confirmed the sale of a 50% stake in his publishing and masters catalog to the Hipgnosis Songs Fund,[2] founded by Canadian music industry executive and entrepreneur Merck Mercuriadis.

Life and career[edit]
Early life[edit]
Johnson was born on February 1, 1948, in Buffalo, New York, to Mabel (née Sims) and James Ambrose Johnson Sr. He was one of eight children. He was an altar boy and choir member at St. Bridget's Catholic Church.[3] James's father, an autoworker, left the family when James was 10. His mother was a dancer for Katherine Dunham, and later worked as a cleaner in the day, and as a numbers-runner for the Buffalo crime family at night to earn a living.[4][5] James's mother would take him on her collecting route, and it was in bars where she worked that James saw performers such as John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Etta James perform.[5] James claimed later, in the autobiography Glow, that he lost his virginity at "age 9 or 10" to a 14-year-old local girl, claiming his "kinky nature came in early."[5] James eventually attended Bennett High School prior to dropping out. James was introduced to drugs at an early age and was arrested for burglary as a young teen.[5] Due to his stints in jail for theft, James entered the United States Navy Reserve at 14 or 15, lying about his age, to avoid the draft. During that time, he also became a drummer for local jazz groups in New York City.[5] Due to his missing his twice-monthly Reserve sessions aboard USS Enterprise, he found himself ordered to Vietnam.[5]
Early career[edit]
In 1964, James fled to Toronto.[6] Soon after his arrival three drunk men tried to attack him outside a club; a trio of other men came to his aid. One of them, Levon Helm, was at the time was a member of Ronnie Hawkins' backing band.[7] Helm invited James to their show later that night and he ended up performing onstage with the band.[6] In Toronto James made friends with local musicians Neil Young and Joni Mitchell.[5] To evade US military authorities, James went under the assumed name "Ricky James Matthews".[5] That same year, James formed The Mynah Birds, a band that produced a fusion of soul, folk and rock music. In 1965, the band briefly recorded for the Canadian division of Columbia Records, releasing a single, "Mynah Bird Hop"/"Mynah Bird Song". At one point, Nick St. Nicholas, later of Steppenwolf fame, was a member; by the time "Mynah Bird Hop" was recorded bassist Bruce Palmer had replaced him. James and Palmer recruited guitarists Tom Morgan and Xavier Taylor and drummer Rick Mason to form a new Mynah Birds lineup, and soon traveled to Detroit to record with Motown. Before the group began recording their first songs for the label, Morgan left, unhappy about the label's attitude toward the musicians. Neil Young eventually took his place. It was while in Detroit that James met his musical heroes, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder. After meeting Wonder and telling him his name, Wonder felt the name "Ricky James Matthews" was "too long", and told James to shorten it to "Ricky James".[5]
In 1966, a financial dispute in Toronto between James and the Mynah Birds' handler, Morley Shelman[8][9][10] led to Motown's learning of James's fugitive status with the Navy. Hoping to prevent any scrutiny, Motown execs told Rick they would not be releasing any more of his material and convinced him to come back and work with them after straightening out his legal issues.[8][10] James surrendered himself to the FBI, and, in May 1966, was sentenced by the Navy to five months' hard labor for unauthorized absence. He was not yet 19 years old. James escaped from the Brooklyn Naval Brig after only six weeks' confinement, but following another six months as a fugitive, surrendered himself a second time. With help from his mother, James found legal assistance from his cousin, future Congressman Louis Stokes, and another attorney, former Marine Captain John Bracken, who pled James's second court-martial down from a potential five years' hard labor to five months.[5][11] After his release from Portsmouth Naval Prison in August 1967, James returned to Toronto[12] and endured another detention, initially derailing resumption of his career with Mynah Bird bandmate Neil Merryweather, with whom he would later collaborate, first at Motown and then in Los Angeles.[10][13]
In 1968, again working under the pseudonym Ricky Matthews, James produced and wrote songs at Motown for acts such as The Miracles, Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers, and The Spinners. According to James, he briefly got involved in pimp activity during this time, but stopped because he felt he was not qualified for it due to the harsh activity and the abuse of women there.[5] It was during this third stint at Motown that James met musician Greg Reeves. Reeves, hoping to find a better situation than the US$38 a week (US$662 in 2021 dollars[14]) he was earning as a session bassist for Berry Gordy, joined James, looking to "hitch a lift from Neil Young's rising star," and relocated to Los Angeles.[15]
On one of his first nights in Los Angeles, James was crashing on musician Stephen Stills' couch. When he awoke he saw a stoned young man sitting on the floor in the lotus position. The man's wrists were bleeding so a scared James sought help. James was later formally introduced to the man who was Jim Morrison, lead singer of the Doors. After the Doors opened for Buffalo Springfield at the Whisky a Go Go, Morrison tricked James into taking acid.[6]
In California, James initially worked as a duo with Greg Reeves, but soon after James introduced Reeves to Neil Young, it was Reeves, not James, who was hired as bassist for the newly formed rock supergroup, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.[5][16] Around this time James formed several versions of the rock band Salt'N'Pepper[16] and got involved with hair stylist Jay Sebring, who agreed to invest in his music.[5] James claimed that in 1969 Sebring invited him to attend a party at actress Sharon Tate’s house, but he was too hungover to get out of bed. The next morning he discovered that Sebring had been murdered when he saw the Los Angeles Times headline "Sharon Tate, Four Others Murdered."[7][6]
In 1970, James and Salt'N'Pepper member Ed Roth participated in the recording of Bruce Palmer's solo album The Cycle Is Complete. The duo also recorded as part of the group Heaven and Earth in Toronto. Heaven and Earth eventually changed their name to Great White Cane and recorded a self-titled album for the Los Angeles label Lion Records, released in 1972. James formed another band, Hot Lips, afterwards. He also briefly replaced Mendelson Joe in the Toronto blues band McKenna Mendelson Mainline.[17] During this period, James and Mainline guitarist Mike McKenna co-wrote the song "You Make the Magic", which would later be released by The Chambers Brothers as a B-side to their single "Boogie Children."[18]
Solo career[edit]
In 1973, James signed with A&M Records, where his first single under the name Rick James, "My Mama", was released in 1974, becoming a club hit in Europe.[5]
In 1976, James returned to Buffalo and formed the Stone City Band. Shortly thereafter, he recorded "Get Up and Dance!", his second single to be released. In 1977, James and the Stone City Band signed a contract with Motown's Gordy Records imprint, where they began recording their first album in New York City.
In April 1978, James released his debut solo album, Come Get It!, which included the Stone City Band. The album launched the top 20 hit, "You and I", which became his first number-one R&B hit. The album also included the hit single, "Mary Jane". It eventually sold two million copies, launching James's musical career to stardom, and helping out Motown Records at a time when label fortunes had dwindled.[19] In early 1979, James's second album, Bustin' Out of L Seven, followed the previous album's success, eventually selling a million copies. A third album, Fire It Up, was released in late 1979 going gold. Around that same period, James launched his first headlining tour, the Fire It Up Tour, and agreed to invite the then-upcoming artist, Prince, as well as singer Teena Marie, as his opening act.[5] James had produced Marie's successful Motown debut album, Wild and Peaceful and was featured on the hit duet, "I'm a Sucker (For Your Love)". James was credited with naming Marie, "Lady Tee", on the song, a nickname that stuck with Marie for the rest of her career. The Fire It Up tour led to James developing a bitter rivalry with Prince, after he accused the musician of ripping off his act.[5]
"Super Freak"

Following the end of the tour in 1980, James released the ballads-heavy Garden of Love, which became his fourth gold record. In 1981, James recorded his best-selling album to date, Street Songs, which like his previous four albums, was a concept album. Street Songs featured a fusion mix of different genres, including rock and new wave, as well as James's brand of crossover funk, enabling James's own style of "punk funk". The album featured hit singles such as "Ghetto Life", the Teena Marie duet "Fire and Desire", "Give It to Me Baby", and his biggest crossover hit to date, "Super Freak", which peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot 100, and sold over 1 million copies. Street Songs peaked at number one R&B and number three pop, and sold over 3 million copies alone in the United States.[19] Following up that success, James released two more gold albums, 1982's Throwin' Down and 1983's Cold Blooded.
During this period, when Prince also became a success as a producer of other acts including The Time and Vanity 6, James launched the acts Process and the Doo-Rags, and the Mary Jane Girls, featuring his former background singer Joanne "JoJo" McDuffie as the lead vocalist and background performer, finding success with the latter group, due to the hits, "All Night Long", "Candy Man", and "In My House". In 1982, James produced the Temptations' Top 10 R&B hit, "Standing on the Top". In 1983, James recorded the hit duet, "Ebony Eyes", with singer Smokey Robinson, as well as a ballad "Tell Me What You Want" with an introduction by Billy Dee Williams. In 1985, James produced another hit for entertainer Eddie Murphy with the song "Party All the Time". That same year he appeared on an episode of The A-Team with Isaac Hayes. After the release of his ninth solo album, The Flag, in 1986, James signed with Warner Bros. Records, which released the album Wonderful in 1988, featuring the hit, "Loosey's Rap".
James's controversial and provocative image became troublesome sometimes. Famous for promoting the use of marijuana live in concerts during a time that simple possession could lead to a long-term prison sentence, James was often threatened by cops in various cities that he would be arrested if he smoked marijuana on stage during performances of songs such as "Fire It Up" and "Mary Jane". According to Kerry Gordy, most Motown executives erroneously thought the latter song was a "simple cute love song to a girl" not knowing the song was about marijuana.[citation needed]
James's overtly sexual bravado made it tough for him to be a bigger mainstream act. After the debut of the fledgling music video network MTV in August 1981, James tried to present the music video to "Super Freak" to the label, only for the channel to turn the video down. James accused the network of racism.[20] MTV denied this, stating the real reason "Super Freak" was turned down by MTV was because they felt James's video was too vulgar for the channel. When younger artists such as Michael Jackson and Prince found fame on the channel, James accused the two singers of being "tokens" in a 1983 interview, demanding that any black artist that has a video aired on MTV take their video off the channel in protest. James's rant was cosigned by David Bowie, who argued with MTV VJ Mark Goodman about the lack of black artists being featured on the channel despite the successes of Jackson and Prince.[21]
When MTV and BET both avoided playing the video for "Loosey's Rap" because of its graphic sexual content, James considered the networks hypocritical in light of them still playing provocative videos by artists such as Madonna.[citation needed]
Decline[edit]
In 1989, James's 11th album, Kickin', was released only in the UK. By 1990, he had lost his deal with Reprise/Warner Bros., and James began struggling with personal and legal troubles. That year MC Hammer released his hit signature song, "U Can't Touch This", which sampled the prominent opening riff from "Super Freak". James and his co-writer on "Super Freak", Alonzo Miller, sued Hammer for shared songwriting credit and all three received a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song in 1991.[22][23]
In 1997, James released Urban Rapsody, his first album since his release from prison on assault charges and he toured to promote the album. That year, he discussed his life and career in interviews for the VH1 musical documentary series, Behind the Music, which aired in early 1998. James's musical career slowed again after he suffered a minor stroke during a concert in 1998.[24] He was featured on the song "Love Gravy" with Ike Turner for the 1998 soundtrack album Chef Aid: The South Park Album.[25] James accepted an offer by Eddie Murphy to appear in the comedy-drama Life (1999).[26]
Resurgence[edit]
Chappelle's Show[edit]
In early 2004, after years out of the spotlight, James participated in a comedy sketch on Chappelle's Show, in a segment called "Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories." James and Murphy recounted humorous stories of their experiences together during the early 1980s. During the sketch, James's character, played by Dave Chappelle, utters the now famous catchphrase, "I'm Rick James, bitch!" The sketches were punctuated by James, explaining his past behavior with the phrase, "Cocaine is a hell of a drug!"
James enjoyed a career revival after his appearance on the show. He supported Teena Marie's tour of her album La Doña and toured with her in May 2004; playing with her at the KBLX Stone Soul Picnic, Pioneer Amphitheatre, Hayward, California.[27] James gave his last public appearance and performance at the fourth annual BET Awards on June 29, 2004. He performed a live rendition of "Fire & Desire" with Teena Marie. James called out a girl backstage who didn't recognize him by saying, "Never mind who you thought I was, I'm Rick James, bitch!" The audience erupted and gave James a standing ovation as he walked off the stage.[28]
Autobiography[edit]
At the time of his death, James was working on an autobiography, The Confessions of Rick James: Memoirs of a Super Freak, as well as a new album. The book was finally published in 2007 by Colossus Books and features a picture of his tombstone. Noted music journalist/biographer David Ritz, who had been employed by James to work on the book with him, later said that this version did not truly reflect how the musician wanted himself portrayed. In 2014, Ritz published his own, re-edited version, Glow: The Autobiography of Rick James.[29]
Documentary[edit]
In 2021, James was the subject of a documentary film ''Bitchin': The Sound and Fury of Rick James'' directed by Sacha Jenkins that was produced and broadcast by Showtime.[30] According to Rotten Tomatoes, the documentary has 100% positive reviews from 13 professional reviewers.[31]
Personal life[edit]
Relationships and children[edit]
James had two children with Syville Morgan, a former singer and songwriter. They had a daughter, Tyenza, and a son, Rick Jr.
James dated actress Linda Blair from 1982 to 1984. They met after James read an interview where Blair called him sexy. He contacted her and spent time getting to know the actress during a short stint living at the Chateau Marmont in Hollywood.[32] Early in their relationship, Blair became pregnant and had an abortion. James wrote in his memoir, "I loved Linda and it hurt me that she would choose to abort our child without even wanting to talk to me about it first. I still look back on her choice with sadness and wonder about our baby, and how having that child might have changed my life."[33][page needed] His hit song "Cold Blooded" was about his relationship with Blair. "It was about how Linda could freeze my blood," he wrote in his memoir.[7]
In 1989, James met 17-year-old party-goer Tanya Hijazi. The two began a romance in 1990. In 1993, the couple had their only child and James's youngest, Tazman. Following their respective releases from prison for assaulting Mary Sauger and Frances Alley,[34][35] they married in 1996 and divorced in 2002.
James was very close with Teena Marie, whom he met and began collaborating with in 1979. Teena Marie stated they were engaged "for two weeks."[36] Their professional partnership lasted into 2004, when Marie released her comeback album, La Doña, which included her and James's duet "I Got You". When James died, Teena Marie said she was "devastated by his death" and struggled with a painkiller addiction following his passing.[37]
Friendships[edit]
James had a close friendship with Eddie Murphy, whom he met in 1981. He was also close to Murphy's older brother Charlie Murphy, who worked as a security guard for his brother. On the Chappelle show skits, Charlie Murphy recalled occasions of mistreatment by James.
James was good friends with actress Debbie Allen. Allen once invited James to a Broadway show and sent a car to pick him up; during the show, James fell asleep due to exhaustion from prior sexual activities. Afterwards, Allen confronted him in the dressing room. She pinned him down and pleaded that he was throwing his life away. "All you do is get high and have sex," she said. He promised to change his ways, but he broke his promise that same night.[7][6]
James was also a friend of fellow Motown act performers Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye, singers James idolized as a teenager. Additionally, he befriended Gaye's second wife, Janis, and he was godfather of Gaye's daughter Nona.[38] James's relationship with Robinson began shortly after James signed with Motown and, in 1983, the duo recorded the hit "Ebony Eyes".
James also idolized former Temptations lead singer David Ruffin and Ruffin's self-proclaimed cousin, bass vocalist Melvin Franklin, and grabbed at the chance to produce the hit "Standing on the Top" for them in 1982. Before that, the then-current lineup of the group recorded background vocals on two James-associated projects—James's Street Songs (singing "Ghetto Life" and "Super Freak") and Teena Marie's It Must Be Magic (singing on the title track). In "Super Freak", "It Must Be Magic", and "Standing on the Top", James famously shouted out, "Temptations, SING!"[citation needed]
Drug abuse and health problems[edit]
James's drug abuse began in his teens, first with marijuana and heroin.[5] He began using cocaine in the late 1960s. His cocaine addiction increased by the 1980s, and he began freebasing by the end of the decade. When he smoked crack cocaine in his Beverly Hills mansion, he often put aluminum foil on the windows to block onlookers.[5] Although James claimed that he quit cocaine when he entered prison, his autopsy showed there was a small amount of the drug in his bloodstream at the time of his death.[39]
His drug use led to major health problems. In April 1984, he was hospitalized after being found unconscious at his house by a friend.[40] In 1998, James suffered a stroke after a blood vessel ruptured in his neck during a concert at Mile High Stadium in Denver.[24] Earlier that year he had hip replacement surgery to repair bone damage "from jumping around on stage and substance abuse."[24]
Kidnapping and assault convictions[edit]
By the 1990s, James's drug abuse was public knowledge. He was heavily addicted to cocaine and later admitted to spending about $7,000 per week on drugs for five years straight. On August 2, 1991, James and his girlfriend Tanya Hijazi were arrested on charges of holding 24-year-old Frances Alley hostage for up to six days, tying her up, forcing her to perform sexual acts, and burning her legs and abdomen with the hot end of a crack cocaine pipe during a week-long cocaine binge.[35][41] James faced a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted on all charges, which included assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated mayhem, torture, forcible oral copulation, false imprisonment and kidnapping.[34]
On November 3, 1992, while out on bail for that incident, James, under the influence of cocaine, assaulted music executive Mary Sauger at the St. James Club and Hotel in West Hollywood. Sauger claims she met James and Hijazi for a business meeting, but said the two then kidnapped and beat her over a 20-hour period.[34]
James was found guilty of both offenses but was cleared of a torture charge that could have put him in prison for the rest of his life. While serving his five-year sentence at Folsom Prison, James lost a civil suit to Sauger, who was awarded nearly $2 million in damages in 1994.[42] James was ordered to pay her about $1 million; the hotel and a private security firm were found liable for nearly $750,000 in damages due to negligence.[43] James was released from prison on August 21, 1996, after serving more than two years.[44]
In 1998, James was accused of sexually assaulting a 26-year-old woman, but the charges were later dropped.[45] In 2020, James's estate was sued for $50 million by a woman who accused him of raping her when she was 15 years old at a group home for troubled youths in Buffalo, New York in 1979.[46][47] The suit was later dismissed.[48]
Death[edit]
 James' grave at Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo, New York
On the morning of August 6, 2004, James's caretaker found him dead in his Los Angeles home at the Oakwood Toluca Hills apartment complex, just outside Burbank. He was 56 years old. His longtime publicist, Sujata Murthy, released a statement to the media stating he died of natural causes.[49] James died from pulmonary failure and cardiac failure, associated with his various health conditions of diabetes, a stroke, pacemaker, and heart attack. His autopsy found alprazolam, diazepam, bupropion, citalopram, hydrocodone, digoxin, chlorpheniramine, methamphetamine, and cocaine in his blood.[50] However, the coroner stated that "none of the drugs or drug combinations were found to be at levels that were life-threatening in and of themselves".[50]
Following a public viewing for fans, a private memorial was held at Forest Lawn Memorial Park - Hollywood Hills.[51] A public funeral was held at St. John Baptist Church in Buffalo, New York on Saturday, Aug. 14, 2004, with an estimated 6000 fans attending the viewing, and cremation following the service; a free tribute concert took place later that day in Martin Luther King Park.[52][53][3] James was buried at the Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo.[54]

James received the following honors:
1982: American Music Award for Favorite Soul/R&B Album (Street Songs)
1996: Inducted into the Buffalo Music Hall of Fame.[55]

Plot[edit]
‘Pardes Mein Mila Koi Apna’ is a conflicting love story- a story of a romance and a bond between two contrasting individuals, who are forced to get married in the face of unavoidable circumstances. 
Nirupama, who belongs to a small village ravaged by drought, is forced to come to Mumbai to save her father who is bordering on insanity. Niru who is motherless had promised herself that she would forever be with her father- and never get married and leave him. Unaware of her destiny, she makes every effort to keep her promise and goes all out, even at the cost of sacrificing her own desires and needs. Hurdles created by her own people, she faces all odds- especially the taunts and ill treatment meted out to her by her own sister who considers them a burden. And when all hope in her life seems to fade away, she then meets a man of her dream Chandu and almost unwittingly, falls in love with him.
Chandu who is a soft romantic at heart- is the sole hope in his family. A good student, his father who is a constable has high hopes from him as his other son has dashed his aspirations for him. Chandu's younger sister is Sonali who is a positive, sensitive and energetic, bubbly girl who is playful and witty with Chandu and helps him and brother Sarje in difficulties. She is also a TV Actress who is shown as playing characters in television serials and helps Chandu and Niru's relationship to grow. Chandu is a lovable sweet boy who meets Niru at a nightclub where they both perform and it is here that their love story blossoms. At first Niru fights this love she feels for Chandu, as she does not want to break her promise. Finally when both accept their love for each other, they realize that their love is doomed as Niru's suitor from her basti Albela Suman (who is her sisters devar) and Chandu's brother Sarje are arch enemies.
An accident causes Chandu to die. Niru is depressed and she finds out that she is pregnant with his child. She becomes scared not knowing what to do. Sarje finds out about Niru's preganacy and marries (since he loved her anyway). Niru hates Sarje but has no other choice but to marry him. Chandu's family blames Niru for Chandu's death and reprimand Sarje for marrying his brother's 'killer' (they don't know about her pregnancy). At first Niru is indifferent towards Sarje, but sees him change. (Due to low trp ratings show ended) In the last episode she accepts Sarje.

Salix breweri is a species of willow known by the common name Brewer's willow. It is endemic to California, where it can be found in the serpentine soils of the Coast Ranges in and around the San Francisco Bay Area. It is a riparian shrub growing one to four meters in height. The yellowish or reddish brown stems are lightly hairy in texture, the small twigs coated in velvety fibers. The leaves are generally lance-shaped, smooth-edged or gently toothed, and partially rolled under along the edges. The leaves are hairy, with the lower surfaces often quite woolly. Mature leaves may be 14 centimeters long or more. The inflorescence is a catkin which develops before the plant produces leaves. The catkins are up to 5 or 6 centimeters long, the female ones lengthening further as the fruits develop.

Black Christmas (originally titled Silent Night, Evil Night in the United States) is a 1974 Canadian slasher film produced and directed by Bob Clark, and written by A. Roy Moore. It stars Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, Margot Kidder, Andrea Martin, Marian Waldman, Lynne Griffin and John Saxon. The story follows a group of sorority sisters who receive threatening phone calls and are eventually stalked and murdered by a deranged killer during the Christmas season.
Inspired by the urban legend "the babysitter and the man upstairs" and a series of murders that took place in the Westmount neighbourhood of Montreal, Quebec, Moore wrote the screenplay under the title Stop Me. The filmmakers made numerous alterations to the script, primarily the shifting to a university setting with young adult characters. It was shot in Toronto in 1974 on an estimated budget of $620,000, and was distributed by Warner Bros. in North America.
Upon its release, Black Christmas received mixed reviews, but it has since received critical re-appraisal, with film historians noting it for being one of the earliest slasher films.[3] It is also praised for its influence on John Carpenter's Halloween (1978). Aside from its earning a cult following[4] since its release, a novelization written by Lee Hays was published in 1976. It is the first film in the Black Christmas series, being followed by two remakes in 2006 and  2019. The film has since received retroactive recognition and has been regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made.[5][6]

Plot[edit]
An unseen man climbs the exterior of a sorority house, where a Christmas party is being held, and enters the attic. The house phone rings, and Jess Bradford answers to discover it is an obscene phone call from a person who has called before known as "The Moaner". Jess calls the other sorority girls and they listen as the caller rants, moans, and screams in strange voices. The girls are initially startled by the caller, but Barb, an inebriated student, insults the caller; after a moment of bickering, the caller threatens to kill them in sudden low tone. A younger student, Clare Harrison, suggests that the caller could be a rapist before returning to her bedroom to pack her suitcase. Right when she leaves, Mrs. MacHenry, the housemother, arrives and is immediately given a negligee by the girls. As Clare packs her things upstairs, she fails to notice the intruder hiding behind a plastic dress bag; Clare eventually hears the cat meowing from the closet and slowly approaches it, only to be suffocated with a plastic dress bag. As the party wraps up, the killer carries Clare’s body into the attic and places her into a rocking chair by the attic window.
The following morning, Clare's father arrives to take her home for Christmas break, but she fails to show up. Mrs. MacHenry assumes Clare went to the fraternity house for a party, and helps Mr. Harrison look for her. Later that day, Jess goes to a conservatory to meet her boyfriend, Peter, and explains to him that she is pregnant and planning to get an abortion. This angers Peter, and he forces her to continue this discussion later that night. In town, Mr. Harrison, Barb, and Phyl attempt to report Clare as missing to Sergeant Nash, who doesn’t take them seriously. At the police station, they learn that a high school girl, Janice Quaife, has also vanished.
After putting a drunken Barb to bed, Mr. Harrison, Chris, Jess, and Phyl help search for the missing girl. Meanwhile, the housemother, Mrs. MacHenry, discovers Clare's body and the killer throws a crane hook into her face, hanging and killing her. In the park, the missing girl's disfigured body is found by the police. Jess answers another obscene phone call and decides to file a report with the police, only for Peter to surprise her. He attempts to persuade her into marriage, but she refuses and reaffirms her decision to have an abortion. Peter leaves angrily while Lieutenant Fuller arrives with a telephone lineman to bug the phone.
Jess stays up to pick up the phone, but leaves when she hears Barb having an asthma attack; Barb claims that she had a nightmare where she saw a man walk into her room. After calming her down, Jess hears Christmas Carolers at the front door and leaves Barb unattended. The killer walks into Barb's room and stabs her to death with a glass unicorn figurine; her cries for help are drowned out by the caroling. Jess experiences another unnerving phone call, in which the caller restates her argument with Peter. Lieutenant Fuller calls her to say the attempt to trace the call failed, and theorizes that Peter could be responsible, but Jess doubts this. After Jess and Phyl are spooked by a couple of search party members, they set out and lock up every door and window in the house. Phyl sees Barb’s door close, and goes to check in on her, only for her to be killed off-screen.
Jess gets one final phone call in which the killer alludes to some sort of transgression between two children named Agnes and Billy. The call is long enough to be traced, and Sergeant Nash instructs Jess to leave the house immediately, as the calls are coming from within the house. Concerned for Barb and Phyl, she ventures upstairs, where she discovers their bodies. Jess sees the killer’s eye through a door crack as he slowly begins to close it on her; she slams the door in his face and runs downstairs. Jess flees into the basement and locks it shut as the killer bangs on it. She then hears footsteps walking away and (presumably) the front door opening. However, when she walks downstairs into the basement, Jess sees Peter peek through a window and call her name; he breaks a window and enters the basement as he calls her name worriedly. Once Peter finds her, he begins to approach her as she backs away and clutches the fire poker.
The police arrive and hear Jess screaming; they discover her barely conscious in the basement with Peter's bloody body next to her. Believing that Peter was the killer, they put Jess to bed in her room and leave her alone in the house, with a cop standing outside. The killer's voice is heard from the attic, implying that he is still alive. The still-undiscovered bodies of Clare and Mrs. MacHenry are seen through the attic window before the house's telephone begins to ring, leaving Jess' fate ambiguous.

Production[edit]
This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it.  (March 2019)
Development[edit]
Black Christmas was  initially developed by Canadian screenwriter Roy Moore, who wrote the screenplay under the title Stop Me.[11] Inspirations for the film came from the urban legend known as "The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs",[12] which had become widespread during the 1970s.[13][14] Moore also claimed to have been inspired by a series of murders that occurred during the holiday season in the Westmount area of Montreal.[15][16] As noted in an article for The Telegraph, the murders, which occurred in 1943, were perpetrated by a fourteen-year-old boy who bludgeoned several of his family members to death.[8]
Film producers Harvey Sherman and Richard Schouten had Timothy Bond rewrite the script to give it a university setting.[12][17] Clark, who had felt the original script was too much of a straightforward slasher film, made several alterations in dialogue,[12] and also incorporated humorous elements into the film, particularly the drunkenness of Barb, and Mrs. Mac, who Clark based on his aunt.[11] Clark felt that college and high school students had not been depicted with "any sense of reality" in American film, and that he intended to capture the "astuteness" of young adults: "College students—even in 1974—are astute people. They're not fools. It's not all 'bikinis, beach blankets, [and] bingo'".[11]
Casting[edit]
 The central cast of Black Christmas (clockwise from left to right): Olivia Hussey, Keir Dullea, John Saxon, and Margot Kidder.
Olivia Hussey, who had previously garnered international fame for her role as Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's Romeo and Juliet (1968), signed on to appear in the film after being told by a psychic that she would "make a film in Canada that would earn a great deal of money".[11] Clark sought Keir Dullea to play the role of Peter based on his performance as Dave Bowman in 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968).[11] The role of Mrs. Mac was offered to Bette Davis,[12] who declined the part.[11] Margot Kidder was cast in the role of Barb, and said she had been attracted to the character "because she was wild and out of control", and not a "conventional leading" part.[11] For the role of Clare Harrison, whose murder jump-starts the film's plot, Toronto native Lynne Griffin was cast after her mother, who was also her casting agent at the time, got her an audition. Griffin would later go on to star in Curtains (1983), and in the acclaimed television series Wind at My Back (1996–2001).[18]
Gilda Radner was offered the role of Phyllis Carlson. She accepted the part, but dropped out one month before filming began owing to Saturday Night Live commitments, and was replaced by Andrea Martin.[12][11] The role of Lieutenant Fuller was originally given to Edmond O'Brien. Upon his arrival to the set, however, the producers realized he would be unable to fulfill the duties required of the part due to his failing health (stemming from Alzheimer's disease).[9] John Saxon, who had read the script prior, was called by the producers who offered him the role. He accepted, and had to arrive in Toronto from New York City within two days to begin shooting.[11] For the role of the film's antagonist, Italian-American actor Nick Mancuso was cast as one of the main voices in the phone call sequences. When auditioning for the role, director Clark had Mancuso sit in a chair facing away from him, so as not to see the actor's face. Clark then had Mancuso experiment with different voices in order to come up with one that was right for the character, with Clark later offering him the part.[8]
John Saxon had appeared in the first giallo.[19]
Filming[edit]
 Soldiers' Tower at the University of Toronto is featured in the film.
Black Christmas was shot on location in Toronto in the winter of 1973–74. The house featured in the film had been discovered by Clark while scouting for locations, and its owners agreed to lease the home for the production.[11] Additional photography was completed on the University of Toronto campus.[11] According to John Saxon, Clark had meticulously drawn out storyboards with key shots, which he brought to the film set each day: "I could understand exactly what I thought he needed, and the scene needed".[11] Scenes in the film involving POV shot of Billy scaling the house was accomplished through the use of a rig designed by camera operator Bert Dunk, which was attached to Dunk's head as he climbed up the side of the house.[10] Griffin's death scene, which was shot with a handheld camera in a real closet, was accomplished in only a couple of takes. According to Griffin, her character's surprise as the killer lunges from the closet was genuine as the actress later recalled: "It was a total shock because I didn't really know when to expect him to jump out!" Shots of Clare's corpse in the rocking chair required the actress to wear an actual plastic bag over her head for extended periods of time. Griffin would also state that these scenes came relatively easy for her: "I was actually, and still am, a fairly good swimmer so I could hold my breath for a long time. And I could also keep my eyes open for a long time without blinking".[18]
Margot Kidder remembered shooting the film as being "fun. I really bonded with Andrea Martin, filming in Toronto and Ontario. Olivia Hussey was a bit of an odd one. She was obsessed with the idea of falling in love with Paul McCartney through her psychic. We were a little hard on her for things like that".[20]
Post-production[edit]
The composer of the film's score, Carl Zittrer, stated in an interview that he created the film's mysterious music by tying forks, combs, and knives onto the strings of the piano to warp the sound of the keys.[9] Zittrer also stated that he would distort the sound further by recording its sound onto an audiotape and make the sound slower.[9] The audio for the disturbing phone calls was performed by multiple actors including Mancuso[12][8] and director Bob Clark.[9] Mancuso stated in an interview that he stood on his head during the recording sessions to compress his thorax and make his voice sound more demented.[7] Mancuso spent only three days recording dialogue for the character, later recalling the experience as being very "avant-garde", with Clark encouraging him to improvise with the character's voice.[8]
During preparation in 1975 for the film's American release, Warner Bros. studio executives asked Clark to change the concluding scene to show Clare's boyfriend, Chris, appear in front of Jess and say, "Agnes, don't tell them what we did" before killing her. However, Clark insisted on keeping the ending ambiguous. The original title of the film was initially planned to be Stop Me.[12] Clark has stated in an interview that he came up with the film's official title, saying that he enjoyed the irony of a dark event occurring during a festive holiday. According to Clark as well, Warner Bros. changed the title to Silent Night, Evil Night for the United States theatrical release.[9]
Release[edit]
Theatrical distribution[edit]
Black Christmas was distributed in Canada by Ambassador Film Distributors and released in Toronto on October 11, 1974.[21] In the United States, Warner Bros. released the film in tandem with the Christmas season on December 20, 1974.[22] For the American release, Warner Bros. initially changed the title to Silent Night, Evil Night, worried that the original title would mislead audiences into believing the film was a blaxploitation movie.[11] They retracted the title after the initial release, restoring it to Black Christmas for subsequent screenings.[11]
The film later screened in October 1975 in New York City and Chicago,[23] as well as 19 theaters in Los Angeles, where it generated considerable ticket sales. This prompted Warner Bros. to expand the release to a total of 70 theaters nationwide in time for Halloween, but the film only generated a daily average of $700 per theater, per day, after which Warner Bros. withdrew the film from circulation in December.[24] The film had previously screened under the alternative title Silent Night, Evil Night in Virginia in July 1975.[25]
The film was the third-highest-grossing Canadian film of all-time in Canada with a gross of $2 million, behind The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz (1974) and the French language Deux femmes en or (1970), directed by Claude Fournier.[26][27]
Overall, Black Christmas grossed over $4,053,000 internationally, managing to earn more than its budget of $620,000.[28] When released in the UK, the BBFC had the word "cunt" removed, as well as several other crude and sexual references during the first obscene phone call.[29]
Television premiere controversy[edit]
The film, under the title Stranger in the House, was set to make its network television premiere on Saturday night, January 28, 1978, on NBC's weekly "Saturday Night at the Movies". Two weeks prior to its premiere, the Chi Omega Sorority House on the campus of Florida State University in Tallahassee was the scene of a double murder in which two Chi Omega sisters, asleep in their beds, were bludgeoned to death. The killer then went to a nearby room in the sorority house and violently attacked two more sleeping co-eds, who survived. The killer was later identified as Ted Bundy, who was executed for this and other homicides on January 24, 1989.[30]
A few days before the film was set to premiere on network television Florida's then-Governor Reubin Askew contacted NBC President Robert Mullholland to request the movie not be shown due to its all-too-similar theme as the murders of sorority sisters by an unknown madman at the Chi Omega Sorority House. On Tuesday, January 24, NBC-TV gave several of its affiliates in Florida, Georgia, and Alabama, the option of showing an alternate film, Doc Savage: The Man of Bronze, in place of Stranger in the House.[30]
The report revealed that "the network said in a statement issued yesterday in New York City that it was responding to concern voiced by the affiliates because of the murder of two coeds this month in a sorority house at Florida State University in Tallahassee".[30]
Critical response[edit]
During its initial release, the film had garnered mixed reviews. A. H. Weiler of The New York Times called it "a whodunit that raises the question as to why was it made".[31] Variety called the film "a bloody, senseless kill-for-kicks feature, [that] exploits unnecessary violence in a university sorority house operated by an implausibly alcoholic ex-hoofer. Its slow-paced, murky tale involves an obscene telephone caller who apparently delights in killing the girls off one by one, even the hapless house-mother".[32] Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and called it a "routine shocker" that "is notable only for indicating the kind of junk roles that talented actresses are forced to play in the movies".[33] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote: "Before it maddeningly overreaches in a gratuitously evasive ending, Black Christmas (opening today at selected theaters) is a smart, stylish Canadian-made little horror picture that is completely diverting ... It may well be that its makers simply couldn't figure out how to end it".[34]
Later reviews have been more positive. On Rotten Tomatoes, Black Christmas holds an approval rating of 71% based on 34 reviews, with an average rating of 6.26/10. The website's critics consensus reads: "The rare slasher with enough intelligence to wind up the tension between bloody outbursts, Black Christmas offers fiendishly enjoyable holiday viewing for genre fans".[35] On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on nine critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".[36]
Heidi Martinuzzi of Film Threat called the film "innovative" and praised the leading actresses, Olivia Hussey and Margot Kidder.[37] TV Guide awarded the film three out of four stars, writing: "Although strictly standard fare, the material is elevated somewhat through Clark's skillful handling of such plot devices as obscene phone calls from the killer to the girls via the upstairs phone and a nicely handled twist ending, which provides a genuine shock".[38]
Author and film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film two and a half out of four stars calling it "bizarre" but also praised Kidder's performance as a standout.[39] The Time Out film guide noted that the film "manages a good slice of old-fashioned suspense".[40]
Home media[edit]
Black Christmas has been released on DVD several times in North America. A 25th Anniversary edition was released in Canada on November 6, 2001 by Critical Mass.[41] This edition only contains the theatrical trailer as a bonus feature.[42] The following year, on December 3, 2002, Critical Mass released a Collector's Edition of the film on DVD with making-of documentaries, two audio commentary tracks, and reversible English and French cover artwork.[43]
On December 5, 2006, Critical Mass released a third "Special Edition" DVD with a newly remastered transfer, two original scenes with newly-uncovered vocal tracks, a new documentary on the making of the film, and cast and crew interviews.[44] This edition was later released on Blu-ray on November 11, 2008.[45]
Anchor Bay released a Blu-ray and DVD in Canada, titled the "Season's Grievings Edition". It contains the same transfer of the film as the "Special Edition" release and all previous bonus content, plus the addition of a new documentary ("Black Christmas Legacy"), a 40th-anniversary panel from Fan Expo 2014, a new commentary track featuring Nick Mancuso as the character "Billy", a new retrospective booklet written by Rue Morgue Magazine, and new packaging art by Gary Pullin (art director of Rue Morgue Magazine). This new edition was released on Blu-ray and DVD on November 24, 2015.[46]
In the United States, Scream Factory released the film in a collector's edition Blu-ray on December 13, 2016, with a new transfer and new extras.[47] The Scream Factory release collates all of the bonus materials from the previous releases by Critical Mass and Anchor Bay, and also features the 2006 Critical Mass restoration of the film in the bonus materials.[47]

Legacy[edit]
Black Christmas eventually gained a cult following, and is notable for being one of the earliest slasher films. It went on to inspire other slasher films, the biggest one of all being John Carpenter's Halloween (which was apparently inspired by Clark suggesting what a Black Christmas sequel would be like).[53][11][54]
Black Christmas has been included in multiple lists in various media outlets as one of the greatest horror films ever made. The film ranked No. 87 on Bravo's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments.[55] It was ranked at No. 67 in IndieWire's The 100 Best Horror Movies of All Time, its entry stating that "the plot sounds formulaic, but Black Christmas remains timeless thanks to its terrifying and elusive killer, 'Billy', whose backstory is never revealed, as well as a foreboding ending that doesn't offer much hope for the film's Final Girl".[5] Thrillist's Scott Weinberg, in his article The 75 Best Horror Movies of All Time, ranked the film at No. 48.[6] Paul Schrodt of Esquire placed the film at No. 23 in his list of the 50 Best Horror Films of All Time.[56] In 2017, Complex magazine named Black Christmas the 2nd-best slasher film of all time.[57] The following year, Paste listed it the 3rd-best slasher film of all time,[58] while also placing the character Jess Bradford at #1 in their list of "20 Best 'Final Girls' in Horror Movie History".[59] While director Clark maintained he did not intend for the film to have political leanings, critics have noted Black Christmas is nonetheless a feminist film for its treatment of female characters—particularly Jess having agency and making the choice to have an abortion—and its portrayal of casual misogyny (as when the police initially fail to take the sorority’s concerns about the phone calls and Clare’s absence seriously).[60][61][62] Film critic Tim Dirks of the film-review website Filmsite.org added the film to his list of films featuring the "Greatest Film Plot Twists, Film Spoilers and Surprise Endings", based on the film's major plot twists - the revelation that the real killer was hidden inside the unsearched attic, and Jess' implied murder.[63]
Olivia Hussey told Bravo during an interview about their 100 Scariest Movie Moments series, that when she met Steve Martin for the first time, he told her that she starred in one of his favorite films of all time. Hussey initially thought he was referring to Romeo and Juliet, but was surprised when Martin said it was Black Christmas and that he had seen the film 27 times.[64]
Related works[edit]
Novelization[edit]
A novelization of the film written by Lee Hays was published in 1976 by Popular Library.[65][66] The book follows roughly the same plot, but sticks with Roy Moore's original script. Because of this, the novel ends up fleshing out the characters more, adding scenes and lines of dialogue that were initially cut from the film's final script, and giving the Pi Kappa Sigma property more backstory.[67]
It's Me Billy: Black Christmas Revisited[edit]
A new book chronicling the behind the scenes making of the original film (as well as time given to the remakes), was made available in 2022. The book features new interviews with original cast members and more, and was written by author Paul Downey of Bloody-Flicks and filmmaker Dave Hastings.[68]
Remakes[edit]
Main articles: Black Christmas (2006 film) and Black Christmas (2019 film)
Black Christmas has been remade on two separate occasions, with the films differing significantly from the original.
The first remake was directed by Glen Morgan and was released on December 25, 2006. It is loosely based on the original film, containing more graphic content and a focus into the past of Billy. Andrea Martin was the only original cast member to appear in the film, and Bob Clark served as an executive producer.[69]
The second remake was made by Blumhouse Productions, directed and written by Sophia Takal, co-written by April Wolfe and produced by Jason Blum.[70][71][72] Starring Imogen Poots and Cary Elwes, the film was released on December 13, 2019.[73]
It's Me, Billy: A Black Christmas Fan Film[edit]
A short fan film funded through an Indiegogo campaign was released on YouTube and Vimeo with the title "It's Me, Billy", in May 2021. It is billed as an "unofficial sequel" to the original film and picks up the story 50 years later, following the granddaughter of Jess Bradford. The film was written, produced, and directed by Dave McRae and Bruce Dale and acts as a concept for a feature film as well as the first part of a 2 part story. The film is available for free. It's Me, Billy was nominated for Best Cinematography in the Dramatic Short category at the 65th annual CSC (Canadian Society of Cinematographers) awards.[74][75][76]

Early life[edit]
Gilbert was born on October 30, 1996,[1] to parents Dennis Sr. and Kim Gilbert.[2] Growing up, he refused to play hockey year round in order to play lacrosse and football.[3]
Playing career[edit]
Gilbert played junior hockey with the Buffalo Jr. Sabres in the Ontario Junior Hockey League and the Chicago Steel in the United States Hockey League (USHL) before he was selected in the third round, 90th overall, in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft by the Chicago Blackhawks.
Gilbert played collegiate hockey for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at the University of Notre Dame, originally of Hockey East.[4] In his sophomore season with the Fighting Irish in 2016–17, Gilbert helped guide Notre Dame to the Frozen Four and was announced as the Hockey East's Best Defensive Defenseman and a Hockey East Third Team All-Star.
Gilbert concluded his collegiate career following his junior season with the Fighting Irish in the 2017–18 season, turning professional by signing a three-year, entry-level contract with the Chicago Blackhawks on April 14, 2018.[5]
Entering the final year of his entry-level deal on October 10, 2020, Gilbert was traded by the Blackhawks, alongside Brandon Saad, to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Nikita Zadorov and Anton Lindholm.[6]
Following two seasons in Colorado, Gilbert left as a free agent and was signed to a two-year, $1.525 million contract with the Calgary Flames on July 13, 2022.[7]

The white, stone church was built in a long church style in 1951 using plans drawn up by the architect Finn Bryn (1890-1975). The church seats about 300 people.[1][2][3]
History[edit]
 Old church (before WWII)
The first church in Kjøllefjord was built around the year 1670 after the medieval Skjøtningberg Church was closed. In 1738, the small, timber church was torn down and replaced with a new, larger church on the same site. The church was originally a cruciform design, but it was later converted to a long church design.[4]
In 1814, this church served as an election church (Norwegian: valgkirke).[5] Together with more than 300 other parish churches across Norway, it was a polling station for elections to the 1814 Norwegian Constituent Assembly which wrote the Constitution of Norway. This was Norway's first national elections. Each church parish was a constituency that elected people called "electors" who later met together in each county to elect the representatives for the assembly that was to meet in Eidsvoll later that year.[5][6]
On 4 November 1944, the old church was burned to the ground by the retreating German army near the end of the Occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany. This was the first church rebuilt after the war. The funding for the church was from the Kingdom of Denmark which gave it as a gift to help with the rebuilding after World War II.[4]

Shintaro Ishihara (石原 慎太郎, Ishihara Shintarō, 30 September 1932 – 1 February 2022) was a Japanese politician and writer who was Governor of Tokyo from 1999 to 2012. Being the former leader of the radical right Japan Restoration Party,[1] he was one of the most prominent ultranationalists in modern Japanese politics.[2][3] An ultranationalist, he was infamous for his misogynistic comments, racist remarks, xenophobic views and hatred of Chinese and Koreans, including using the antiquated pejorative term "sangokujin".[4][5][6]
Also a critic of relations between Japan and the United States, his arts career included a prize-winning novel, best-sellers, and work also in theater, film, and journalism. His 1989 book, The Japan That Can Say No, co-authored with Sony chairman Akio Morita (released in 1991 in English), called on the authors' countrymen to stand up to the United States.
After an early career as a writer and film director, Ishihara served in the House of Councillors from 1968 to 1972, in the House of Representatives from 1972 to 1995, and as Governor of Tokyo from 1999 to 2012. He resigned from the governorship to briefly co-lead the Sunrise Party, then joined the Japan Restoration Party and returned to the House of Representatives in the 2012 general election.[7] He unsuccessfully sought re-election in the general election of November 2014, and officially left politics the following month.[8]

Early life and artistic career[edit]
Shintaro Ishihara was born in Suma-ku, Kobe. His father Kiyoshi was an employee, later a general manager, of a shipping company. Shintaro grew up in Zushi, Kanagawa. In 1952, he entered Hitotsubashi University, and he graduated in 1956. Just two months before graduation, Ishihara won the Akutagawa Prize (Japan's most prestigious literary prize) for the novel Season of the Sun.[9][10] His brother Yujiro played a supporting role in the movie adaptation of the novel (for which Shintaro wrote the screenplay).[11] Ishihara had dabbled in directing a couple of films starring his brother. Regarding these early years as a filmmaker, he said to a Playboy Magazine interviewer in 1990 that "If I had remained a movie director, I can assure you that I would have at least become a better one than Akira Kurosawa".[12][13]
In the early 1960s, he concentrated on writing, including plays, novels, and a musical version of Treasure Island. One of his later novels, Lost Country (1982), speculated about Japan under the control of the Soviet Union.[14] He also ran a theatre company, and found time to visit the North Pole, race his yacht The Contessa and cross South America on a motorcycle. He wrote a memoir of his journey, Nanbei Odan Ichiman Kiro.[15]
From 1966 to 1967, he covered the Vietnam War at the request of Yomiuri Shimbun, and the experience influenced his decision to enter politics.[16] He also was mentored by the influential author and political "fixer" Tsûsai Sugawara.[17]
Political career[edit]
In 1968, Ishihara ran as a candidate on the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) national slate for the House of Councillors. He placed first on the LDP list with an unprecedented 3 million votes.[18] After four years in the upper house, Ishihara ran for the House of Representatives representing the second district of Tokyo, and again won election.[citation needed]
In 1973, he joined with thirty other LDP lawmakers in the anti-communist Seirankai or "Blue Storm Group"; the group gained notoriety for sealing a pledge of unity in their own blood.[11]
Ishihara ran for Governor of Tokyo in 1975 but lost to the popular Socialist incumbent Ryokichi Minobe. Minobe was 71 at the time, and Ishihara criticized him as being "too old".[19]
Ishihara returned to the House of Representatives afterward, and worked his way up the party's internal ladder, serving as Director-General of the Environment Agency under Takeo Fukuda (1976) and Minister of Transport under Noboru Takeshita (1989). During the 1980s, Ishihara was a highly visible and popular LDP figure, but was unable to win enough internal support to form a true faction and move up the national political ladder.[20] In 1983 his campaign manager put up stickers throughout Tokyo stating that Ishihara's political opponent was an immigrant from North Korea. Ishihara denied that this was discrimination, saying that the public had a right to know.[21]
In 1989, shortly after losing a highly contested race for the party presidency, Ishihara came to the attention of the West through his book The Japan That Can Say No, co-authored with Sony chairman Akio Morita. The book called on his fellow countrymen to stand up to the United States.[22]
Governor of Tokyo[edit]
 Ishihara in 2006 Emergency Drill
In the 1999 Tokyo gubernatorial election, he ran on an independent platform and was elected as Governor of Tokyo. Among Ishihara's moves as governor, he:
Cut metropolitan spending projects, including plans for a new Toei Subway line, and proposed the sale or leasing out of many metropolitan facilities.[14]
Imposed a new tax on banks' gross profits (rather than net profits).[23]
Imposed a new hotel tax based on occupancy.[24]
Imposed restrictions on the operation of diesel-powered vehicles, following a highly publicized event where he held up a bottle of diesel soot before cameras and reporters.[25]
Imposed cap and trade energy tax.[26]
Proposed opening casinos in the Odaiba district.[14]
Declared in 2005 that Tokyo would bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics, which discouraged a bid by Fukuoka.[27] Tokyo's bid lost to that of Rio de Janeiro.
Set up the ShinGinko Tokyo bank to lend to SMEs (small medium enterprises) in Tokyo. This bank has lost approximately 1 billion dollars worth of taxpayers' money through inadequate customer risk assessments.[28]
Served as Chairman of Tokyo's successful bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics.[29]
Generated controversy from PETA for the culling of the 37,000 crows that populated Tokyo.[30]
He won re-election in 2003 with 70.2% of the vote,[citation needed] and re-election in 2007 with 50.52% of the vote.[citation needed] In the 2011 gubernatorial election, his share of the vote dipped to 43.4% against challenges by comedian Hideo Higashikokubaru and entrepreneur Miki Watanabe.[citation needed]
On 25 October 2012, Ishihara announced he would resign as Governor of Tokyo to form a new political party in preparation for upcoming national elections.[31] Following his announcement, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly approved his resignation on 31 October 2012, officially ending his tenure as Governor of Tokyo for 4,941 days, the second-longest term after Shunichi Suzuki.[citation needed]
Sunrise Party[edit]
Ishihara's new national party was expected to be formed with members of the right-wing Sunrise Party of Japan, which he had helped to set up in 2010.[19] When announced by co-leaders Ishihara and SPJ chief Takeo Hiranuma on 13 November 2012, Sunrise Party incorporated all five members of SPJ. SP would look to form a coalition with other small parties including Osaka Mayor Toru Hashimoto's Japan Restoration Party (Nippon Ishin no Kai).[32]
In November 2012, Ishihara and his co-leader Hiranuma said that the Sunrise Party would pursue "establishment of an independent Constitution, beefing up of Japan's defense capabilities, and fundamental reform of fiscal management and tax systems to make them more transparent". The future of nuclear power and the upcoming consumption tax hike were issues it would have to address with potential coalition partners.[32]
Sunrise Party merger with the Japan Restoration Party[edit]
Only four days after the Sunrise Party was launched, on 17 November 2012, Ishihara and Tōru Hashimoto, leader of the Japan Restoration Party (JRP), decided to merge their parties, with Ishihara becoming the head of the JRP. Your Party would not join the party, nor would Genzei Nippon, as the latter party's anti-consumption tax increase policy did not match the JRP's pro-consumption tax policy.[33]
Reporting on a poll in early December 2012, Asahi Shimbun characterized the merger with Japan Restoration Party as the latter having "swallowed up" Sunrise. The poll, in advance of the 16 December Lower House elections, also said the association with SP could hurt JRP's chances of forming a ruling coalition even though JRP was showing strength relative to the ruling DPJ.[34]
Party for Future Generations[edit]
In the December 2014 general elections he was a candidate for the Party for Future Generations, an extreme right-wing party, but was defeated.[4] Following this, he retired from politics.[citation needed]
Political views[edit]
Ishihara is generally described as having been one of Japan's most prominent extreme right-wing politicians.[35][36][37] He was called "Japan's Le Pen" on a program broadcast on Australia's ABC.[38] He was affiliated with the openly ultranationalist organization Nippon Kaigi.[39]
Foreign relations[edit]
Ishihara was a long-term friend of the prominent Aquino family in the Philippines.  He is credited with being been the first person to inform future President Corazon Aquino about the assassination of her husband Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. on 21 August 1983.[40]
Ishihara was often been critical of Japan's foreign policy as being non-assertive. Regarding Japan's relationship with the U.S., he stated that "The country I dislike most in terms of U.S.–Japan ties is Japan, because it's a country that can't assert itself."[20] As part of the criticism, Ishihara published a book co-authored with the then Prime minister of Malaysia, Mahathir Mohamad, titled "No" to ieru Ajia – tai Oubei e no hōsaku in 1994.[41]
Ishihara was also long critical of the government of the People's Republic of China. He invited the Dalai Lama and the President of the Republic of China Lee Teng-hui to Tokyo.[14]
Ishihara was deeply interested in the North Korean abduction issue, and called for economic sanctions against North Korea.[42] Following Ishihara's campaign to bid Tokyo for the 2016 Summer Olympics, he eased his criticism of the PRC government. He accepted an invitation to attend the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and was selected as a torch-bearer for the Japan leg of the 2008 Olympic Torch Relay.[43]
Views on foreigners in Japan[edit]
On 9 April 2000, in a speech before a Self-Defense Forces group, Ishihara said crimes were repeatedly committed by illegally entered people, using the pejorative term sangokujin, and foreigners. He also speculated that in the event a natural disaster struck the Tokyo area, they would be likely to cause civil disorder.[44][45] His comment invoked calls for his resignation, demands for an apology and fears among residents of Korean descent in Japan,[14] as well as being criticised by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.[46][47]
Regarding this statement, Ishihara later said:I referred to the "many sangokujin who entered Japan illegally." I thought some people would not know that word so I paraphrased it and used gaikokujin, or foreigners. But it was a newspaper holiday so the news agencies consciously picked up the sangokujin part, causing the problem.
... After World War II, when Japan lost, the Chinese of Taiwanese origin and people from the Korean Peninsula persecuted, robbed and sometimes beat up Japanese. It's at that time the word was used, so it was not derogatory. Rather we were afraid of them.
... There's no need for an apology. I was surprised that there was a big reaction to my speech. In order not to cause any misunderstanding, I decided I will no longer use that word. It is regrettable that the word was interpreted in the way it was.[20]
On 20 February 2006, Ishihara also said: "Roppongi is now virtually a foreign neighborhood. Africans—I don't mean African-Americans—who don't speak English are there doing who knows what. This is leading to new forms of crime such as car theft. We should be letting in people who are intelligent."[48]
On 17 April 2010, Ishihara said "many veteran lawmakers in the ruling-coalition parties are naturalized or the offspring of people naturalized in Japan".[49]
Other controversial statements[edit]
In 1990, Ishihara said in a Playboy interview that the Rape of Nanking was a fiction, claiming, "People say that the Japanese made a holocaust but that is not true. It is a story made up by the Chinese.  It has tarnished the image of Japan, but it is a lie."[50][51] He continued to defend this statement in the uproar that ensued.[52] He also backed the film The Truth about Nanjing, a Japanese film that denies the atrocity.[53]
In 2000, Ishihara, one of the eight judges for a literary prize, commented that homosexuality is abnormal, which caused an outrage in the gay community in Japan.[54]
In a 2001 interview with women's magazine Shukan Josei, Ishihara said that he believed "old women who live after they have lost their reproductive function are useless and are committing a sin," adding that he "couldn't say this as a politician." He was criticized in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly for these comments, but responded that the criticism was driven by "tyrant… old women."[55]
During an inauguration of a university building in 2004, Ishihara stated that French is unqualified as an international language because it is "a language in which nobody can count", referring to the counting system in French, which is based on units of twenty for numbers from 70 to 99 rather than ten (as is the case in Japanese and English). The statement led to a lawsuit from several language schools in 2005. Ishihara subsequently responded to comments that he did not disrespect French culture by professing his love of French literature on Japanese TV news.[56]
At a Tokyo IOC press briefing in 2009, Governor Ishihara dismissed a letter sent by environmentalist Paul Coleman regarding the contradiction of his promoting the Tokyo Olympic 2016 bid as 'the greenest ever' while destroying the forested mountain of Minamiyama, the closest 'Satoyama' to the centre of Tokyo, by angrily stating Coleman was 'Just a foreigner, it does not matter'. Then, on continued questioning by investigative journalist Hajime Yokota, he stated 'Minamiyama is a Devil's Mountain that eats children.' Then he went on to explain how unmanaged forests 'eat children' and implied that Yokota, a Japanese national, was betraying his nation by saying 'What nationality are you anyway?' This was recorded on film[57] and turned into a video that was sent around the world as the Save Minamiyama Movement[58]
In 2010, Ishihara claimed that Korea under Japanese rule was absolutely justified due to historical pressures from Qing dynasty and Imperial Russia.[59]
In reference to the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Ishihara said "that the disaster was 'punishment from heaven' because Japanese have become greedy".[60][61][62]
America's identity is freedom. France's identity is freedom, equality and fraternity. Japan has no sense of that. Only greed. Material greed, monetary greed.[63]
This greed bounds with populism. These things need to be washed away with the Tsunami. For many years the heart of Japanese always bounded with devil.[64]
Japanese's identity is greed. We should avail of this tsunami to wash away this greed. I think this is a divine punishment.[65]— Ishihara Shintaro
However, he also commented that the victims of this disaster were pitiable.[66]
This speech quickly caused many controversies and critical responses from the public opinion, both inside and outside Japan. The governor of Miyagi expressed displeasure about Ishihara's speech, claimed that Ishihara should have considered the victims of the disaster. Ishihara then had to apologize for his comments.[67]
During the 2012 Summer Olympics, Ishihara stated that "Westerners practicing judo resembles beasts fighting. Internationalized judo has lost its appeal." He added, "In Brazil they put chocolate in norimaki, but I wouldn't call it sushi. Judo has gone the same way."[68]
Ishihara has said that Japan ought to have nuclear weapons.[69]
Proposal to buy the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands[edit]
On 15 April 2012, Ishihara made a speech in Washington, D.C., publicly stating his desire for Tokyo to purchase the Senkaku Islands, called the Diaoyu Islands by mainland China, on behalf of Japan in an attempt to end the territorial dispute between China and Japan, causing uproars in Chinese society and increasing tension between the governments of China and Japan.[70][71]
Personal life and death[edit]
Ishihara was married to Noriko Ishihara and had four sons. Members of the House of Representatives Nobuteru Ishihara and Hirotaka Ishihara are his eldest and third sons; actor and weatherman Yoshizumi Ishihara is his second son. His youngest son, Nobuhiro Ishihara, is a painter.[72] The late actor Yujiro Ishihara was his younger brother.[citation needed]
He died from pancreatic cancer at his home in Ōta, Tokyo[citation needed] on 1 February 2022, at the age of 89.[73][74][75]

Career[edit]
Adiamoh was born in Ibadan to a teacher and architect. The second of six children, he attended Ibadan Grammar School, Ibadan and Ladoke Akintola University, Ogbomosho, Nigeria. He left Nigeria during the Abacha administration and settle in the Gambia, where he established himself as a business journalist with the Daily Observer Newspaper. He left the Observer to start his own company, first called MediaMethods and then INK. He started the Business Gambia, a monthly business magazine, in association with the Gambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Today Newspaper first published in July 2007.
Challenges[edit]
In September 2007, Adiamoh was arrested for publishing an article on children skipping school, picking scrap metal, and selling it to scrap dealers.[1][2] According to the charge sheet brought against him, he was accused of seditious intention.[3] Media reports of the event cite the attempt by state forces to stifle the media. His arrest and bail (in 200,000 Gambian dalasi,[3] corresponding to about USD 9500) coincided with the conviction and sentencing of Fatou Jaw Manneh, another journalist who was found guilty of a 2005 article.[4]
Adiamoh was also arrested in June 2009 for false publication.[5] TODAY had on June 10 reported the sack of two Gambian ministers - Attorney General Marie Saine Firdaus and minister for Local Government, Ismaila Sambou as part of a landslide cabinet reshuffle.[6][7] Finding the report to be untrue, TODAY of June 11, 2009 retracted the story, and published a public apology. The paper also mentioned its efforts to stop the circulation of the edition. Despite these efforts, Adiamoh was arrested, detained for five days, before he was charged for false publication and broadcasting, a criminal offence under Gambian laws that could carry a maximum sentence of D250,000  fine or a six-month imprisonment term.
Adiamoh lives in the Gambia with his family.

History[edit]
The first historical record of the Zaremba coat of arms appears on the bishop of Poznań's seal in 1301 CE. In the 12th century, the Zaremba clan itself founded the town and endowed the church of Tuliszkow.[2] Tuliszkow would become the seat of the Zaremba clan and in 1450, Mikolaj Zaremba, castellan of Leczyca, built the St. Vitus church, which still stands today.[3]
The Zaremba coat of arms is mentioned by Romain Gary in his novel Promise at dawn.[4]

Elvis (also known as Elvis Presley No. 2) is the second studio album by  American rock and roll singer Elvis Presley. It was released through RCA Victor on October 19, 1956 in mono. Recording sessions took place on September 1, September 2, and September 3 at Radio Recorders in Hollywood, with one track left over from the sessions for Presley's debut album at the RCA Victor recording studios on January 30 in New York.[6] It spent four weeks at #1 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart that year, making Presley the first recording artist to have both albums go straight to number one in the same year. It would go on to spend 5 weeks at #1 in total. It was certified Gold on February 17, 1960, and Platinum on August 10, 2011, by the Recording Industry Association of America.[7]
It was originally released in UK in 1957 as Elvis Presley No. 2 with a different front cover (on His Master's Voice CLP1105). It was also cataloged as Rock 'n' Roll No. 2. The original U.S. release inaugurated the practice (applied inconsistently for the first few years, but commonly afterwards) of crediting Presley only by his first name on album sleeves, though his full name continued to be used on labels.

Content[edit]
RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes had commissioned two new songs for this batch of sessions, "Paralyzed" from Otis Blackwell and "Love Me" from Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, the authors of Presley's summer hit of 1956, "Hound Dog," the first record to top all three of the Billboard singles charts then in existence: Pop, R&B, and C&W.[8] Presley decided upon three Little Richard covers, and selected three new country ballads respectively from regular Everly Brothers writer Boudleaux Bryant and guitarist Chet Atkins, Sun staff musician and engineer Stan Kesler, and Aaron Schroeder and Ben Weisman. The latter two, contracted to Hill and Range, the publishing company of Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, would write dozens of songs for Presley through the 1960s. Also included was the song with which Presley won second prize at a fair in Tupelo when he was ten years old, Red Foley's 1941 country song, "Old Shep."
With all but one track on the album recorded at a single set of sessions over three days in September, Presley and his touring band of Scotty Moore, Bill Black, and D.J. Fontana, along with The Jordanaires, managed to recreate the loose feel from Sun Studio days, mixing rhythm and blues and country and western repertoire items as they had on all of his Sun singles.[9] They reinforced this effect by including material echoing his very first Sun record: a blues by Arthur Crudup, author of "That's All Right (Mama);" and a song recorded by bluegrass founder Bill Monroe, "When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again."  The  sessions were attended by a few outsiders, namely his current girlfriend at the time, actress Natalie Wood and actor Nick Adams, both of whom had starred in Rebel Without a Cause, Presley's favorite James Dean film. Steve Sholes was the RCA man at the session, and handled the paper work and such, but Elvis himself chose the songs and led the session.[10]
The piano player on this album is not registered in the official RCA Victor archives, except for the song "So Glad You're Mine", which was cut at a previous session in New York. In a 1984 interview conducted by Jan-Erik Kjeseth, Gordon Stoker of the Jordanaires stated that he was the piano player on most of the songs on the album. In an article written by Kjeseth for the Flaming Star magazine, it was argued that the piano player on "Love Me", "Old Shep" and "How's the World Treating You" was Elvis himself. Ernst Jørgensen, writer of Elvis Presley - A Study in Music, seems to be of the same opinion. Kjeseth also claims that Elvis played the piano on the single from this session, "Playing for Keeps". Again, Jørgensen seems to be of the same opinion. Gordon Stoker played the piano on "Rip it Up" and "Anyplace is Paradise".
Reissues[edit]
RCA first reissued the original 12 track album on compact disc in 1984. This issue, in reprocessed (fake) stereo sound, was quickly withdrawn and the disc was reissued in original mono. 
RCA reissued an expanded edition of the album  in 1999, and again in 2005. For the 1999 reissue, six bonus tracks were added that were both sides of three singles, altering the running order. Four of the tracks were chart-toppers: "Love Me Tender", "Too Much", and the double-sided classic "Hound Dog" and "Don't Be Cruel". Bonus tracks recorded on July 2 at RCA Studios in New York City, in September at Radio Recorders, and "Love Me Tender" at 20th Century Fox Stage One during the sessions for Love Me Tender. 
The 2005 reissue was remastered using DSD technology with the six bonus tracks appended in standard fashion, in the following order: "Playing for Keeps", "Too Much", "Don't Be Cruel", "Hound Dog", "Any Way You Want Me (That's How I Will Be)", and "Love Me Tender". This acclaimed latest remaster was the handiwork of audio restorer Kevan Budd, who also drew praise for his 2005 remasters of Presley's first and third albums (respectively, Elvis Presley and Loving You) as well as the 2004 upgrade known as Elvis at Sun. These rock-n'roll tapes may have been among those possibly dumped into the Delaware River near RCA Victor's Camden, New Jersey plant in the late 1950s.
In 2014, Elvis was reissued on the Follow That Dream label in a deluxe edition consisting of 2 discs packaged in a 7-inch sleeve.  The first disc contains the original album plus every known outtake from the Labor-Day 1956 sessions. The second disc features a live concert held at Hirsch Coliseum, Youth Center, Louisiana State Fairgrounds on December 15, 1956.[11]

Lausus (eunuch)
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Lausus or Lausos (c. 400 AD. – c. 450 AD) was a eunuch of the court of Theodosius II, famous for acquiring a palace and a large collection of art and sculptures.[1] He also served as imperial chamberlain (praepositus sacri cubiculi) between 420 and 422 AD. One of the oldest historical accounts of the Christian Church, the Historia Lausiaca, was dedicated to him.
The Palace of Lausus, destroyed in a fire in 475, was supplied by the now-preserved Binbirdirek Cistern in Istanbul.

English cricketer
Keith Stevenson (born 6 October 1950) is a former English first-class cricketer who played for Derbyshire from 1974 to 1977 and for Hampshire from 1978 to 1984.
Stevenson was born in Derby. His involvement in cricket began when he was scorer for his father's team before he began playing alongside him at his cricket club.[1]  In 1968 he was playing for Derbyshire Old Juniors and made the Second XI in 1969. He played for the Derbyshire under 25s in 1972, while appearing for the Second XI.[2]  He was meanwhile employed by Rolls Royce Limited in Derby.[1]
Stevenson played for Derbyshire in the Benson & Hedges Cup and John Player League in May 1974 and made his first-class debut in a match against the  Indians in June 1974 in which he scored 25 not out and took  2 for 47. In May 1975 he played in a notable match against Lancashire at Buxton. It started in sweltering heat and Lancashire were able to run up 477 for 5 and take  three wickets for 29 runs before the close of play. The next day Derbyshire defeated Glamorgan in the John Player League on the same ground. However on the Monday the ground was covered by  3 inches of snow and play was impossible. The Derbyshire team feared the worst on the Tuesday, for at that time bowlers' run-ups were protected but the wickets themselves were not and they were dismissed for 42 and 87. Stevenson took his first 5 wicket innings later that season with  5-65 against Essex. In 1976 he took 5-47 against both Somerset and Lancashire and in 1977 took 7-68 against Warwickshire in 1977.[2]
In 1978 after considered transferring in the previous season, Stevenson moved to Hampshire who offered him a longer-term contract than his native Derbyshire.[1] Hampshire won the John Player League that summer defeating a Middlesex side containing nine current and future Test players at Bournemouth to take the title by 26 runs. In 1978 he took  6-73 against Sussex  and 5-72  against Surrey. He achieved his best bowling performance of 7-22 against Oxford University in 1979 after 5-30 against Glamorgan and before 5-106 against Lancashire and 5-40 against Kent. In 1980 he took 5-66 against Worcestershire and 5-86 against Lancashire. He took  5-32 against Nottinghamshire, 5-94 against Glamorgan and 5-49 against his former team Derbyshire in 1981. In 1983 he achieved his last 5 wicket innings with 5-81 against Sussex.[2]
Stevenson was a right-arm fast-medium bowler who took 355 first-class wickets and 117 wickets in One Day competitions. For Derbyshire he took 98 first-class wickets with an average of 30.58 and a best performance of 7 for 68. For Hampshire he took 257 first-class wickets at an average of 29.33 and a best performance of 7 for 22. He was a right-hand batsman and played 167 innings in 146 first-class matches at an average of 9.59 and a top score of 33.[2] He claimed to have made a century once, but in fact this was while acting as a runner for Brian Bolus.[1]
Stevenson left Hampshire in 1984 and followed a career in an estate agency. In 1998 he returned to Derbyshire County Cricket Club when he was appointed Commercial Manager for the club, while remaining in the estate agents business for another ten years.[1] He was also active on behalf of Duffield Cricket Club.[3] Keith retired from the estate agency business in November 2015

Air Force
A squadron in air force, army aviation, or naval aviation is a unit comprising a number of military aircraft and their aircrews, usually of the same type, typically with 12 to 24 aircraft, sometimes divided into three or four flights, depending on aircraft type and air force. Land-based squadrons equipped with heavier type aircraft such as long-range bombers, cargo aircraft, or air refueling tankers have around 12 aircraft as a typical authorization, while most land-based fighter equipped units have an authorized number of 18 to 24 aircraft.
In naval aviation, sea-based and land-based squadrons will typically have smaller numbers of aircraft, ranging from as low as four for early warning to as high as 12 for fighter/attack.
In most armed forces, two or more squadrons will form a group or a wing. Some military forces (including the United States Air Force, United States Space Force, Royal Air Force, Royal Netherlands Air Force, Belgian Air Component, German Air Force, Republic of Singapore Air Force) also use the term "squadron" for non-flying ground units (e.g., radar squadrons, missile squadrons, aircraft maintenance squadrons, security forces squadrons, civil engineering squadrons, range operations squadrons, range management squadrons, weather squadrons, medical squadrons, etc.).

Germany[edit]
In World War I, the Imperial German Army used the term Squadron (staffel), whereas the Austro-Hungarian armed forces and the Swiss Army used the term company. In the modern German Air Force, a flying staffel is a battalion-equivalent, while a ground based support staffel is a company-equivalent. One such example are the air base defence units, which are squadrons (German, plural: Staffeln) formed into battalions. The ground based missile air defence units are also company- (in this case battery-)equivalent squadrons (staffeln).
Sweden[edit]
The Swedish Air Force adopted naval-like traditions in its formative years and for that historical reason calls its squadrons divisions (plural: divisioner). They are grouped into air flotillas (plural: flygflottiljer). During the Cold War the Swedish Army, Navy and Air Force each had their own integral helicopter arms. After the end of it in line with the mid-90s force reduction and reforms they were fused into the Swedish Armed Forces Helicopter Wing as a service, independent from the three main armed forces branches.[8] The Helicopter Wing adopted the term skvadron from the former Swedish Army Aviation for its units, which is squadron in its army company-equivalent meaning. In the early 2000s, the Swedish Air Force absorbed the Helicopter Wing as its fourth combat air wing. Unlike the US Air Force, where the name of the base and the units stationed at that base are not related to each other, the name of the wing (flotilla) is in general considered synonymous with the air base where the unit is stationed. For example, the air base where the F 10 wing is stationed (in Ängelholm) is commonly referred to as F 10 even though it is the name of the tactical unit. In general, this only applies as long as a wing is stationed at the base. Case in point is Uppsala-Ärna air base, an active military airport but since the tactical unit located there has been disbanded it is no longer referred to as F 16. These naming conventions have been inherited from the navy where Swedish military aviation has its roots.
United Kingdom and Commonwealth[edit]
During the infant years of combat aviation in World War I and specifically with the trench stalemate at the front military aircraft partially took over the reconnaissance role from the cavalry. With that in mind the British Royal Flying Corps adopted the squadron nomenclature. After the fusion of the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service into an independent Royal Air Force, the new armed forces branch introduced its own system of ranks, with the commanders of squadrons becoming squadron leaders.
The rapid sophistication in technology and combat tactics has led to increased requirements and qualifications of the officers in command positions and the commanders of RAF flying squadrons were upgraded in the post-World War II period from squadron leaders to wing commanders. Today RAF flying squadrons are battalion-eqivalents, while combat and combat service support ground squadrons such as communications or administrative squadrons are company-equivalents and still usually commanded by squadron leaders.
In the Air Training Corps of the United Kingdom and many Commonwealth nations, a squadron is a group of cadets who parade regularly.
United States[edit]
In the United States Air Force, the squadron is the principal organizational unit.[9] An aggregation of two or more USAF squadrons will be designated as a group and two or more groups will be designated as a wing.[10]
USAF squadrons may be flying units composed of pilots and flight crews, with designations such as fighter squadron, bomb squadron, or airlift squadron. Fighter squadrons may support between 18 and 24 aircraft, while larger aircraft flying squadrons (e.g., bomber, cargo, reconnaissance) may support fewer aircraft. However, non-flying units also exist at the squadron level, such as missile squadrons, aircraft maintenance squadrons, intelligence squadrons, aerospace medicine squadrons, security forces squadrons, civil engineering squadrons and force support squadrons, as well as numerous other examples.[10]
USAF flying squadrons are typically commanded by an aeronautically rated officer in the rank of lieutenant colonel, although some particularly large squadrons, such as the 414th Combat Training Squadron that manages RED FLAG training at Nellis AFB, Nevada will be commanded by an aeronautically rated officer in the rank of full colonel.[11] Non-flying squadrons are also usually commanded by an officer in the rank of lieutenant colonel, but some may also be commanded by officers in the rank of major.
Further information on U.S. Navy squadrons: Dictionary of American Naval Aviation Squadrons
In contrast to the organizational structure of United States Air Force units, where flying squadrons are separate from non-flying squadrons tasked with administrative, aircraft maintenance, or other support functions, flying squadrons in naval aviation in the United States (e.g., United States Navy and United States Marine Corps) typically contain both embedded administrative support functions and organizational level aircraft maintenance functions, plus all their associated personnel, as part of the total squadron manning.[12] With few exceptions, oversight of the majority of these non-flying functions is assigned to the squadron's naval aviators and naval flight officers as their "ground job" in addition to their regular flying duties.[13]
With few exceptions, most U.S. Navy flying squadrons are commanded by aeronautically designated officers in the rank of commander. Exceptions are primarily the Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRS), which are often, though not always, commanded by aeronautically designated captains. Commanding officers (COs) of U.S. Navy flying squadrons other than FRS units will be assisted by an Executive Officer (XO) of the same rank who functions as a second-in-command and who will eventually "fleet up" and relieve the CO as the next CO.[14]
In United States Marine Corps Aviation, in addition to flying units that are patterned in similar fashion to their U.S. Navy counterparts, the nomenclature "squadron" in the Marine Corps is also used to designate all battalion-equivalent, aviation support organizations. These squadrons include: wing headquarters, tactical air command, air control, air support, aviation logistics, wing support, and wing communications squadrons. In contrast to their USN counterparts, USMC flying squadrons and aviation support squadrons, while having a commanding officer (CO) at the lieutenant colonel level, may not have an equivalent rank executive officer (XO), but are moving more toward the USN model. USMC aviation (Flying) squadron XO's are aeronautically designated officers in the rank of Lt.Col or Major.
Also in contrast to USAF flying squadrons, most tactical sea-based and land-based U.S. Naval Aviation squadrons (USN and USMC), vice training squadrons and test and evaluation squadrons, usually do not have more than 12 aircraft authorized/assigned at any one time. Exceptions are USN helicopter mine countermeasures squadrons (17 MH-53), USMC "composite" medium tilt-rotor squadrons assigned afloat as the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) of a Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), (12 MV-22s, 6 AH-1s, 4 CH-53s, 3 UH-1s, and 6 AV-8s). Other squadrons with a large number of Primary Aircraft Assigned (PAA) include Marine heavy helicopter squadrons (16 CH-53s), Marine light/attack helicopter squadrons (18 AH-1s and 9 UH-1s), and Marine attack squadrons (16 AV-8s).
Although part of U.S. naval aviation, United States Coast Guard aviation units are centered on an air station or air facility versus a squadron or group/wing organizational structure. The one exception to this is the Coast Guard's Helicopter Interdiction Squadron (HITRON), which is engaged primarily in counter-narcotics (CN) interdiction operations.[15]
In the United States Army Aviation Branch, flying units may be organized in battalions or squadrons (the latter for air cavalry only) reporting to an aviation brigade. Aircraft maintenance activities are typically assigned to an aviation maintenance company or element in the battalion or brigade.[16]
In the U.S. Civil Air Patrol (CAP), a squadron is the basic administrative unit. As the official civilian auxiliary of the U.S. Air Force, CAP follows the USAF organizational model.
Other countries[edit]
An escadron is the equivalent unit in France's French Air and Space Force (Armée de l'air et de l'espace). It is normally subdivided into escadrilles of eight aircraft. The Spanish Air and Space Force and some air forces of other Spanish-speaking countries follow that tradition (with a squadron called an escuadron and a flight called an escuadrilla), as does the Brazilian Air Force with esquadrão and esquadrilha respectively.
The Royal Canadian Air Force and the Belgian Air Component on the other hand use escadrille as the equivalent of a squadron. The Italian Air Force uses gruppo (group) to denominate its squadrons, as does the Chilean Air Force (grupo de aviación). The Portuguese Air Force (esquadra) and the Polish Air Force (eskadra taktyczna, Polish for tactical squadron) use the term squadron with its etimology originating from the naval and not the army meaning. The Czech Air Force and the Slovak Air Force use the generic term Letka as the squadron equivalent. The Turkish Air Force (filo) and the Hellenic Air Force (μοιρα αεροπορικής (mira aeroporikis) - aviation squadron) use the squadron denomination originating from the army term. The Royal Norwegian Air Force use the skvadron term also originating from the army term. So does the Hungarian Air Force with repülőszázad (Hungarian for aircraft squadron or flying squadron; the cavalry company-equivalent term is század).
Many Eastern European countries use the term originating from the French word escadrille: Russian Air Force - Эскадрилья (eskadril'ya), Ukrainian Air Force - Ескадрилья (eskadril'ya), Belarusian Air Force - Эскадрыльля (eskadryil'ya), Romanian Air Force - escadrila, Bulgarian Air Force - Ескадрила (eskadrila), Serbian Air Force - Ескадрила (eskadrila), Croatian Air Force - eskadrila. The Royal Danish Air Force uses eskadrille, also originating from the French escadrille.

Biography[edit]
Juan Carlos Oblitas, el Ciego, was born in Mollendo, Arequipa on 16 February 1951.
He is married to Virginia Villamarin and has three children (Gisella, Juan Fernando, and Vanessa). He has six grandchildren. His son Juan Fernando has three daughters: Paula, Ariana and Andrea.
As a player, he was a participant at the 1978 and 1982 FIFA World Cups. He obtained 64 international caps with Peru, and won the Copa América 1975. He played at the club level for Universitario and Sporting Cristal in Peru, as well as Elche in Spain, Veracruz in Mexico and R.F.C. Sérésien in Belgium.
As a manager, he won the Primera División Peruana national title with Universitario (1987) and Sporting Cristal (1994, 1995), as well as the Campeonato Ecuatoriano de Fútbol with Liga Deportiva Universitaria de Quito (2005). In the period 1996-99 he coached the Peru national football team, missing the 1998 World Cup finals on goal difference.
After Manuel Burga resigned following a long period of criticism, the new FPF leadership of Edwin Oviedo appointed him as technical director for the national team. There, in January 2017, he helped the new FPF leadership to design the "Minors Plan" project, with the aim to improve the youth football of Peru which has been weaker than most of other CONMEBOL nations, in order to rebuild and reform football development in Peru for the future.[1] He also aimed to make Peru one of major youth football power in South America, hoping to achieve more frequent qualification to the FIFA U-17 and FIFA U-20 World Cups. He also helped designing the Centennial Plan 2022, with its goal is to achieve more World Cup qualification successes, and making the Peruvian youth league one of South America's strongest, as well as the construction of new FPF Academy, the Center of National Teams.  ->[2]

James Bradley Simons (May 15, 1950 – December 8, 2005) was an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour in the 1970s and 1980s.[1][2]
Born in Pittsburgh, and raised in suburban Butler, Pennsylvania, Simons attended Knoch High School in Saxonburg[3] and later was a two-time All-American on the Wake Forest University golf team. He finished T-2 at the 1970 Canadian Amateur and finished runner-up at the 1971 British Amateur to Steve Melnyk.
Simons is probably best remembered for nearly winning the U.S. Open in 1971 as an amateur. At the age of 21, he shot a third-round 65 to take a two-shot lead after 54 holes at Merion Golf Club near Philadelphia. That set up the possibility of Simons becoming the first amateur to win the event since Johnny Goodman in 1933. A stroke out of the lead on the final hole, his tee shot found the rough and he double bogeyed. Simons carded a 76 to finish tied for fifth, three shots out of the Monday playoff, won by Lee Trevino.[4]
Four years earlier, Simons had qualified for the U.S. Open in 1967 at Baltusrol, played just after his junior year in high school.[3] At age 17, he shot 165 (+25) and missed the 36-hole cut by 17 strokes.[5]
Simons won three PGA Tour events during his career and had over three dozen top-10 finishes; his final win came at Pebble Beach in early 1982.[6][7] His best finish in a major championship in the professional ranks was later that year, a tie for fifth in the PGA Championship.[8] He was the first player to win a televised PGA Tour event using a metal driver.
Simons played a handful of events on the Champions Tour after turning 50 in 2000. He was inducted into the Wake Forest University Athletics Hall of Fame in 1996.

Death[edit]
Simons was found dead in the hot tub in his Jacksonville, Florida home at the age of 55. The Jacksonville/Duval County medical examiner's office ruled the cause of death as accidental "multiple drug toxicity".[2][9]

Rafael Orlando Robles Natera (October 20, 1947 – August 13, 1998) was a shortstop in Major League Baseball. He was born in San Pedro de Macorís, Dominican Republic. He was signed by the San Francisco Giants as an amateur free agent before the 1967 season, and later drafted by the San Diego Padres from the San Francisco Giants as the 51st pick in the 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft. He played for the San Diego Padres from 1969 to 1970, and again in 1972.
Robles was the first player to come to bat in San Diego Padres history. On April 8, 1969, he led off the bottom of the 1st against right-hander Don Wilson of the Houston Astros. He reached base on an error by Hall of Fame second baseman Joe Morgan, then stole second base, but did not score.
He was at best an average fielding shortstop (.958) and a below-average hitter (.188) during his brief major league career. (47 games played)
Rafael Robles died in New York, New York at the age of 50. His son Orlando Robles is a New York-based Latin urban artist who goes by the stage name of YoungSosa. In interviews his son has been asked about his father's baseball career and has stated he is very proud of his fathers accomplishments as a professional baseball player.

Format[edit]
The 64 players were placed into four seeded pools, the 16 highest ranked players as of March 21 in Pool A, the next 16 in Pool B, etc. The top seeds (Pool A) are placed into 16 groups in order, with the groups completed by means of a random draw of one player from each of the remaining pools.[3]
Each group was played as a round-robin of match play matches, held on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, with one point awarded for a win and half a point for a tie. The 16 group winners advanced to the knockout stage. If two or more players are tied on points at the end of the group stage, there was a sudden death stroke play playoff between the tied players to determine the winner of the group.[3]
In the knockout stage, the round of 16 was played on Saturday morning, with the quarterfinals on Saturday afternoon. The semifinals were played on Sunday morning, and the final and third place playoff were played on Sunday afternoon. In total, barring withdrawals, those reaching the last four played seven rounds of golf.[3]
Field[edit]
The following players qualified for the field, consisting of the top 64 players available from the Official World Golf Ranking on March 15.[3] They are listed with their world ranking as of March 21, which determined the seedings, and their world ranking as of March 15, which determined qualification, in parentheses.[4]

Foundation[edit]
The Collegiate was on the river bank in the south downtown area of Saskatoon.[1]
Saskatoon's Chinatown was destroyed in the late 1920s to make room for the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate and a legion hall.[2]
The Collegiate was completed in 1931.[3]
On 7 November 1932 a group of unemployed men who had gathered on the school grounds was forcibly removed by a joint force of police and RCMP.[4]
History[edit]
The Collegiate had the largest gymnasium in the city. Its women's basketball team won the provincial championship in the 1932–33 season.[5]
The artist Ernest Lindner started to teach at the Saskatoon Technical Collegiate in 1931, first giving a night course and then becoming a full-time instructor.[6]
He headed the Art Department at the Collegiate from 1936 until 1962.[7]
Ted Pulford (1914-1994) studied under Lindner, who brought him to love watercolor.
He went on to become a noted artist and teacher at Mount Allison University in New Brunswick.[8]
Ivan Kenneth Eyre was another of Lindner's students who became well known as an artist.[9]
Ernest C.F. Chan, born near Canton, China in 1909, came to Canada in 1928.
In 1939 he became a teacher at the Collegiate, the first person from China to teach in a public school in Canada.
Chan became president of the Saskatoon Rotary Club, the Saskatoon Highland Dancing Association, and the Saskatoon Folk Arts Council.[10]
Joan Anderson, later known as Joni Mitchell, took art classes at the Collegiate in the late 1950s.
She studied under Henry Bonli (1927–2011), an Abstract Expressionist painter.[11]
The Collegiate was named the Riverview Collegiate before 1981.[5]

Destruction[edit]
After it closed the collegiate's premises were called the Gathercole building, and continued to house the school board offices for a period. The school board moved out, and after some controversy the building was pulled down in the summer of 2004, and the site was used for the River Landing combination of private and public development.[1]
A coalition of cultural and heritage organizations had fought to convert the building into a market/arts space.
The Heritage Canada Foundation listed the Gathercole building as one of the worst losses of 2004.[3]

History[edit]
The town was named in 1921, because it was near the center of a consolidated high school district (District 34), created from four smaller districts in Stephens County: Wolf Creek, Nellie, Prairie Center, and Pleasant Hill. Until then, students living in the area only had access to eighth grade education in each of the old districts. When Central High was formed, it built a four-room junior high and a senior high school named Central High School.  Lower-grade students attended elementary schools in their former districts. This arrangement lasted until the late 1930s. A fire in 1952 destroyed the original Central High School.[5]
The town incorporated in 1995. Supporters of incorporation wanted this so Central High could prevent annexation by surrounding towns, notably Duncan, Lawton or Marlow. Incorporation would also permit Central High to apply for municipal grants.[5]
Geography[edit]
Central High is located at 34°36′57″N 98°4′49″W﻿ / ﻿34.61583°N 98.08028°W﻿ / 34.61583; -98.08028 (34.615943, -98.080343).[6] The town is 8.5 miles (13.7 km) west of Marlow and 1 mile (1.6 km) north of SH 7.
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 53.8 square miles (139 km2), of which 53.6 square miles (139 km2) is land and 0.1 square miles (0.26 km2) (0.24%) is water.
