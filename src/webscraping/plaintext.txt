Joe Alton Delaney (/dɪˈleɪni/; October 30, 1958 – June 29, 1983)[1] was an American football running back who played two seasons in the National Football League (NFL).[2][3] In his two seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs, Delaney set four franchise records that would stand for more than 20 years. His nephew is Terrace Marshall Jr.
He was a two-time All-American athlete for the Northwestern State Demons football team, as well as a track and field star. Delaney played two seasons with the Chiefs and was chosen as the AFC Rookie of the Year in 1981 by United Press International.[3]
Delaney died on June 29, 1983 while attempting to rescue three children from drowning in a pond in Monroe in northeastern Louisiana. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Citizen's Medal from U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan. While not officially retired, his jersey number while playing for the Chiefs, No. 37, has not been worn since his death.[3]

Early life[edit]
The third of Woodrow and Eunice Delaney's eight children, Delaney was born in Henderson, on October 30, 1958, and attended Haughton High School in Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana.[1][3][4] Discouraged by his father from pursuing his dreams of playing football,[5] Delaney became the starting wide receiver by his junior year at Haughton.[3] Major Division I schools that scouted him included Grambling State,[3] Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana State.[6]
Delaney played for Division I-AA's Northwestern State Demons from 1977 to 1980.[7] After telling his coach of his willingness to play football at the collegiate level, Delaney switched to the running back position.[3] He went on to be an All-American selection in 1979 and 1980.[8] While at Northwestern State, Delaney met his future wife, Carolyn, and they had two children by his senior year.[6]
On October 28, 1978, Delaney carried the ball 28 times and gained 299 yards for Northwestern State against Nicholls State University with 263 of the yards coming in the game's second half.[7] Delaney's rushing stats in the second half of the game are an NCAA record. In the same game, he scored four touchdowns, one of which was on a 90-yard run, as he led his team to a 28–18 victory.[3][7][8]
Delaney finished his career at Northwestern State with 3,047 yards rushing, 31 touchdowns, and 188 points.[7] In 1980, his senior season, he was ranked eighth in the nation in all-purpose rushing yards.[7] On November 22, 1980 he played his last game at Northwestern State and the school retired his jersey, number 44, at halftime.[7][8] Delaney was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 1997.[2]
At Northwestern State, Delaney also starred in track. In high school, he ran the 100 yard dash in 9.4 seconds and was on the Northwestern State track and field team, which won the NCAA 400-meter relay in 1981.[3] He holds the school 200 meter dash record with a time of 20.64 seconds.[8][9]
Professional career[edit]
Delaney was selected in the second round of the 1981 NFL Draft by the Kansas City Chiefs.[10] United Press International named him Rookie of the Year of the American Football Conference for the 1981 NFL season after he rushed for 1,121 yards, set four club records, and averaged 80.9 yards a game.[3][8][10] Delaney's effort helped propel the Chiefs to a 9–7 record, the team's first winning season since 1973.[2][9] In his rookie season, he was selected to the Pro Bowl after setting Chiefs records for most yards in a season (1,121), most yards in a game (193 vs. Houston), most consecutive 100-yard-plus games (three) and most 100-yard games in a season (five).[3][10]
After coming off the bench to record 101 rushing yards in his initial NFL action at New England, he ran for 106 yards and registered 104 receiving yards in his first professional start against Oakland.[9] In the Chiefs' October 18, 1981 game against the Denver Broncos, Delaney broke loose for a 75-yard touchdown run, but an offside penalty caused the play to be restarted from five yards back. On the second play after the penalty, Delaney scored an 82-yard touchdown,[3][11] the longest rushing play from scrimmage in the 1981 NFL season.[1][10]
Following Delaney's record-setting 196-yard rushing performance against the Houston Oilers on November 15, 1981,[12] Oilers defensive end (and future Pro Football Hall of Famer) Elvin Bethea was quoted in saying:[9][13]
I've played against the best–O. J. Simpson, Gale Sayers, Walter Payton and (Delaney) ranks right up there with them ... He is great with a capital G.
A strike by NFL players and an eye injury limited Delaney's playing time in the 1982 NFL season.[8] He underwent surgery to repair a detached retina,[13] and only registered 380 rushing yards in the eight-game shortened season, which the Chiefs finished with a 3–6 record.[1] Delaney averaged 4.6 yards per carry, 9.1 yards per reception, and registered 1,811 all-purpose yards during his career with three touchdowns.[1][14]

Death and legacy[edit]
Delaney had a lifelong history of helping others,[7] and once paid for the funeral of a former teacher whose family could not afford a proper service.[3] On June 29, 1983, Delaney, who was living in nearby Ruston,[15] went with friends to Critter's Creek, an amusement center at Chennault Park in Monroe, Louisiana. While reportedly discouraging swimming children from venturing too far out in a pond, Delaney dove in to save three children who were screaming for help, floundering in a water hole left by recent construction work.[3][7][14][15] The water hole, which covered two acres and was six feet deep,[3][16] was not intended for swimming but to add to the park's aesthetics.[3][17] Despite his inability to swim,[18] Delaney nevertheless tried to rescue the children.[6][19] One child managed to get out of the water without harm and another was taken to an emergency room where he later died; police recovered the body of Delaney and the remaining child.[3][7][17] The amusement park has since been closed to the public.[3][7][15]
 Delaney's name is commemorated at Arrowhead Stadium in the Kansas City Chiefs ring of honor.[5]
Three thousand people attended Delaney's burial and memorial service on July 4 which was held in the sweltering heat of the Haughton High School gymnasium. Many fanned themselves with fans provided by the funeral home to combat the oppressive heat.[3][13][16] President Ronald Reagan honored Delaney with the Presidential Citizens Medal on July 15, and it was presented to Delaney's family by Vice President George H. W. Bush.[3][9][10] Reagan's words were:[7]
He made the ultimate sacrifice by placing the lives of three children above regard for his own safety. By the supreme example of courage and compassion, this brilliantly gifted young man left a spiritual legacy for his fellow Americans.
For the 1983 NFL season, the Chiefs honored Delaney by wearing a circular patch bearing a gold eagle and the number 37 on the upper-left chest of their uniforms. Haughton High School also made a park, Joe Delaney Park, in his memory.[10][20] The NCAA posthumously awarded Delaney the NCAA Award of Valor in 1984.[2][14] Louisiana Governor Dave Treen presented the Louisiana State Civilian Bravery Award to Delaney's family following his death.[14]
Delaney's heroism is honored through an award for one of the NFL's best running backs who also demonstrates admirable character and unselfishness, traits that were embodied by Delaney.[8] The award is given annually by ProFootballTalk.com.
Northwestern State's football permanent team captains award, the Joe Delaney Memorial Leadership award, is named in his honor, as is the annual spring football game ("Delaney Bowl")[9] and a golf tournament that generates support for the athletic program.[6][8] A permanent shrine honoring him sits under the home stands at Northwestern State's Turpin Stadium and his number 44 jersey hangs in the football offices.[6][8] In Virginia, the Delaney Athletic Conference took its name to honor his memory in the fall of 1983, and today 13 Virginia private high schools comprise the DAC.[9]
A group of Chiefs fans in Kansas City formed the "37Forever Foundation", which works with the American Red Cross to provide swimming lessons for underprivileged children.[6][8][16] The Kansas City Chiefs unofficially retired Delaney's jersey number 37 following his death,[16][19] and he was elected to the team's Hall of Fame in 2004.[2] His name is included in the Chiefs' ring of honor at Arrowhead Stadium.[5][9] Delaney is also the uncle of Carolina Panthers wide receiver Terrace Marshall Jr.

Design and description[edit]
The submarines of the K6 sub-class were versions of the preceding K5 sub-class with greater range and diving depth.[1] They displaced 1,133 tonnes (1,115 long tons) surfaced and 1,470 tonnes (1,447 long tons) submerged. The submarines were 80.5 meters (264 ft 1 in) long, had a beam of 7 meters (23 ft 0 in) and a draft of 4.07 meters (13 ft 4 in). They had a diving depth of 80 meters (260 ft).[2]
For surface running, the boats were powered by two 2,100-brake-horsepower (1,566 kW) diesel engines, each driving one propeller shaft. When submerged each propeller was driven by a 600-horsepower (447 kW) electric motor.[3] They could reach 19.75 knots (36.58 km/h; 22.73 mph) on the surface and 8 knots (15 km/h; 9.2 mph) underwater. On the surface, the K6s had a range of 11,000 nautical miles (20,000 km; 13,000 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph); submerged, they had a range of 45 nmi (83 km; 52 mi) at 5 knots (9.3 km/h; 5.8 mph).[1]
The boats were armed with four internal bow 53.3 cm (21.0 in) torpedo tubes and carried a total of ten torpedoes. They were also armed with a single 76.2 mm (3.00 in) L/40 anti-aircraft gun and two single 25 mm (1.0 in) AA guns.[1]
Construction and commissioning[edit]
Ro-37 was laid down as Submarine No. 203 on 9 October 1941 by the Sasebo Navy Yard at Sasebo, Japan.[4] She was renamed Ro-37 on 20 June 1942,[4] and was provisionally attached to the Maizuru Naval District that day.[4] She was launched on 30 June 1942[4] and completed and commissioned a year later on 30 June 1943.[4]
Service history[edit]
Upon commissioning, Ro-37 was attached formally to the Maizuru Naval District and assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups.[4] On 16 September 1943 she was reassigned directly to 6th Fleet headquarters, and she departed Maizuru bound for Truk on 22 September 1943.[4] During her voyage, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 1 in the 6th Fleet on 24 September 1943.[4] She arrived at Truk on 7 October 1943.[4]
First war patrol[edit]
Ro-37 got underway from Truk on 20 October 1943 to begin her first war patrol, assigned a patrol area east of the New Hebrides as part of Submarine Group A.[4] While at sea, she was reassigned to Submarine Division 34 on 31 October 1943, but otherwise her patrol was uneventful.[4] She returned to Truk in November 1943.[4]
Second war patrol[edit]
During the second half of December 1943, Ro-37 took aboard supplies from the auxiliary submarine tender Heian Maru at Truk.[4] On 2 January 1944, Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne (FRUMEL), an Allied signals intelligence unit headquartered at Melbourne, Australia, reported that a Japanese message transmitted from Truk that FRUMEL had intercepted and decrypted said that Ro-37 was scheduled to depart Truk Lagoon via the South Channel at 16:00 on 3 January 1944 and proceed east-southeast on a course of 116 degrees.[4] As FRUMEL had reported, Ro-37 got underway from Truk on 3 January 1944 on her second war patrol, bound for a patrol area off the New Hebrides.[4] The Japanese never heard from her again.[4]
Loss[edit]
Ro-37 was 155 nautical miles (287 km; 178 mi) southeast of San Cristobal in the Solomon Islands on 22 January 1944 when she sighted the United States Navy fleet oiler USS Cache (AO-67), which was on a voyage to Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides in company with the destroyer minesweeper USS Southard (DMS-10).[4] She hit Cache in the port side with one torpedo at 12°08′S 164°23′E﻿ / ﻿12.133°S 164.383°E﻿ / -12.133; 164.383.[4] The explosion opened holes in three of Cache′s oil tanks, damaged other tanks, and blew two men overboard, killing one of them.[4] Southard rescued the other man from the water.[4]
Meanwhile, Cache transmitted a distress signal, which the destroyer USS Buchanan (DD-484) — which was on a voyage from Purvis Bay to Espiritu Santo — received.[4] Buchanan put on flank speed to go to Cache′s assistance.[4] Buchanan made radar contact at a range of 12,750 yards (11,660 m) with what her commanding officer described as a "fairly large" submarine on the surface 130 nautical miles (240 km; 150 mi) east-southeast of San Cristobal and 95 nautical miles (176 km; 109 mi) northwest of where Ro-37 had torpedoed Cache.[4]  After closing to a range of 2,000 yards (1,800 m), Buchanan illuminated Ro-37 with a  searchlight in time to see her submerge.[4] Buchanan then detected Ro-37 on sonar at a range of 1,250 yards (1,140 m).[4] Buchanan dropped 53 depth charges over the next three hours and finally sank Ro-37 at 11°47′S 164°17′E﻿ / ﻿11.783°S 164.283°E﻿ / -11.783; 164.283﻿ (Ro-37).[4] Buchanan′s crew observed an oil slick covering 5 square miles (13 km2) on the surface, and the following morning a large amount of wooden and cork debris was seen floating in the vicinity of the sinking.[4]
On 17 February 1944, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared Ro-37 to be presumed lost in the New Hebrides area with all 61 hands.[4] She was stricken from the Navy list on 30 April 1944.[4]

Jacques ChastenetBornJacques Chastenet de Castaing(1893-04-20)20 April 1893Paris, FranceDied7 February 1978(1978-02-07) (aged 84)Paris, FranceNationalityFrenchOccupationjournalist, historian and diplomatYears active1918–1974Known forLe Temps newspaper (1931–1942)AwardsAcadémie française (1956)
Jacques Chastenet de Castaing (French: [ʃastnɛ]; 20 April 1893, in Paris – 7 February 1978, in Paris) was a French journalist, historian and diplomat.
Le Temps, which first appeared on 25 April 1861, was a major moderate and liberal newspaper. After World War I (1914–18) it moved towards the right and the confederations of major French employers. In 1924 the paper opposed the Cartel des Gauches. Émile Mireaux and Jacques Chastenet were put in charge of the paper in 1931. Their diplomatic positions eventually became those of Great Britain. After the defeat of France in World War II (1939–45) the newspaper's distribution was restricted to the zone libre. It ceased publication on 29 November 1942 following the German invasion of the zone libre.[1]
Chastenet was elected to the Académie française on 29 November 1956.

 Avenue of the Baobabs, one of the most visited places in the country.
Despite a high potential for tourism, tourism in Madagascar is underdeveloped. Madagascar's tourist attractions include its beaches and biodiversity. The island's endemic wildlife and forests are unique tourist attractions.[1] However, historical sites, craftsmen communities, and relaxed cities make it a favorite with return travellers.

Tourist attractions[edit]
 Discovering lemurs
Madagascar has been isolated from the African landmass for approximately 165 million years and its flora and fauna evolved in isolation from that time onwards.[2] The island is one of the world's most biologically diverse areas, and is internationally renowned as a wildlife tourism and ecotourism destination, focusing on lemurs, birds, and orchids.[3]   More than half of the island's breeding birds are endemic.[2] Other native species include the red-bellied lemur, the aye-aye, and the indri (the largest lemur species).[4]
One of the best places to observe the indri is the Analamazoatra Reserve (also known as Périnet), four hours away from the capital.[3] The presence of the indri has helped to make the Analamazoatra Reserve one of Madagascar's most popular tourist attractions.[5]
Historical sites can be found throughout the country, but mostly in the capital, such as the Royal Palace or Rova in Antananarivo or the sacred hill of Ambohimanga nearby, both Unesco world heritage listed sites. A popular route from Antananrivo to Tulear in the south passes through several towns noted for their handicraft: Ambatolampy (aluminium foundry), Antsirabé (gemstones, embroidery, toys), Ambositra (marquetry), and Fianarantsoa.
Tourist numbers[edit]
 Antananarivo, Madagascar's capital city
312,000 tourists visited Madagascar in 2006. Since 1990, the number of tourists in the country has grown at an average rate of 11% each year. 60% of its tourists are French,[6] who form the majority because of cultural and historical links between the countries, and flight routes.[7] People who are interested in the country's botany, lemurs,[7] birds,[8] or natural history also make up a large part of its visitors. These visitors often travel as part of a tour and stay in the country for a long period of time.
In the mid-1990s, tourism was the country's second largest export earner, bringing in US$50 million annually.[3] For 2007, tourism's contribution to Madagascar's GDP (direct and indirect impact) was estimated to account for 6.3% of GDP and 206,000 jobs (5.1% total employment).[6]
The tourist industry was badly damaged in late 2001 because of a political crisis and following economic recession. The number of tourists in 2002 fell, but the tourism industry subsequently recovered and continued to grow steadily.[7] The highest number of incoming arrivals in Madagascar was recorded in 2008, with 375,000 arrivals.  But in 2009 again, a lengthy political crisis affected tourists' arrivals. Only 255,922 tourists set foot in Madagascar in 2012—still an increase of 14% compared to the 2011 numbers. The 2013 figures were again disappointing with 198,816 arrivals—this was an election year, with security issues, notably in Nosy-Be. However, the sector has been growing steadily for a few years; In 2019, 486,000 tourists landed in Madagascar.[9]
Development of tourism[edit]
There is growing interest in the country as a tourist destination.[7] The country has beautiful landscapes and the cultural resources to support tourism. These resources provide many opportunities for the development of both ecotourism and resort based tourism.[6] Despite its growth, the tourism industry is very small. It  is much smaller than those of the neighbouring Seychelles and Mauritius islands, and is the smallest among the islands in the Indian Ocean.[7]
Madagascar's government has promoted tourism as an economic development strategy.[3] With over 70% of the country living in poverty, tourism is seen as a way to reduce poverty and provide economic growth. Tourism is currently the second-largest foreign exchange earner in the country, and the government hopes to increase this share. Still in the early stages of development, there is large potential for the tourist industry to grow as Madagascar's infrastructure improves.
The tourism industry has a number of large challenges. Travel and tourism is poorly diversified, the infrastructure is poor, roads are poorly paved, and airline travel is expensive and unreliable. There are few high quality hotels, and fewer that meet international standards;[7] 
Madagascar has approximately 550 hotels, about 110 of which have been classified as meeting international standards.[6]
Air Madagascar and Air France dominate air travel, which makes the price of flights expensive. The country's status as a long-haul destination further increases prices.[7]
One of the main actors who help the development of tourism in Madagascar is the Ministry of Tourism of Madagascar and also the National Tourism Office of Madagascar. In addition to these two major players in tourism, regional offices have also been placed in the ranks of cities in the country to contribute to the development of tourism in each of their localities. Aside from that, there are numerous travel agencies that organize tours throughout the big island, the most well-known of which is Natura Travel.

Located in the heart of Pinetop-Lakeside, Woodland Lake and the park surrounding it have been called the town's "Crown Jewel."[citation needed] In addition to trout fishing, the lake provides a host of other outdoor recreation opportunities. Woodland Lake lies on Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests property, just west of White Mountain Blvd. in Pinetop.

Description[edit]
Woodland Lake is situated at 6,893 feet (2,101 m). At full capacity, it has a surface area of 18 acres (7.3 ha) with a maximum depth of 20 feet (6.1 m). Because the lake is part of the local irrigation district, at drawdown, it averages 10 acres (4.0 ha). It is shallow and nutrient rich, making it subject to water quality problems in the summer. For this reason, the lake is stocked primarily with catchable-sized rainbow trout in the spring and early summer. The lake also contains a few largemouth bass and channel catfish.
Amenities[edit]
The town of Pinetop-Lakeside maintains Woodland Park, which includes hiking trails, picnic tables and ramadas, barrier-free restrooms, a sand volleyball court, tennis court, two children's playgrounds, some ball fields, a boat ramp and a barrier-free, floating fishing dock.

Plasmid-mediated resistance
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Jump to navigation
Jump to search
 An example plasmid with two areas of antibiotic resistance coding DNA (1,2) and an origin of replication (3).
Plasmid-mediated resistance is the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes which are carried on plasmids. The plasmids can be transferred between bacteria within the same species or between different species via conjugation. Plasmids often carry multiple antibiotic resistance genes, contributing to the spread of multidrug-resistance (MDR). Antibiotic resistance mediated by MDR plasmids severely limits the treatment options for the infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, especially family Enterobacteriaceae.[1] The global spread of MDR plasmids has been enhanced by selective pressure from antibiotic usage in human and veterinary medicine.[2]

Properties of resistance plasmids[edit]
Resistance plasmids by definition carry one or more antibiotic resistance genes. They are frequently accompanied by the genes encoding virulence determinants, specific enzymes or resistance to toxic heavy metals. Multiple resistance genes are commonly arranged in the resistance cassettes. The antibiotic resistance genes found on the plasmids confer resistance to most of the antibiotic classes used nowadays, for example, beta-lactams, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides.[1][3]
It is very common for the resistance genes or entire resistance cassettes to be re-arranged on the same plasmid or be moved to a different plasmid or chromosome by means of recombination systems. Examples of such systems include integrons and transposons.[3]
Most of the resistance plasmids are conjugative, meaning that they encode all the needed components for the transfer of the plasmid to other bacterium. Other smaller plasmids (usually < 10 kb in size) can be mobilized by a conjugative plasmid (usually > 30 kb) in order to be transferred.[3]
R-factor[edit]
This section is about the plasmid. For information about the residual factor in crystallography, see R-factor (crystallography). For the racing video game, see rFactor.
R-factors are pieces of DNA, usually plasmids, that contain antibiotic resistance genes. Resistance genes are ones that give rise to proteins that modify the antibiotic or pump it out. They are different from mutations that give bacteria resistance to antibiotics by preventing the antibiotic from getting in or changing the shape of the target protein. R-factors have been known to contain up to ten resistance genes. They can also spread easily as they contain genes for constructing pili, which allow them to transfer the R-factor to other bacteria. R-factors have contributed to the growing antibiotic resistance crisis because they quickly spread resistance genes amongst bacteria.[4]
Transmission[edit]
Bacteria containing F-factors (said to be "F+") have the capability for horizontal gene transfer; they can construct a sex pilus, which emerges from the donor bacterium  and ensnares the recipient bacterium, draws it in, and eventually triggers the formation of a mating bridge, merging the cytoplasms of two bacteria via a controlled pore. This pore allows the transfer of genetic material, such as a plasmid. Conjugation allows two bacteria, not necessarily from the same species, to transfer genetic material one way.[5] Since many R-factors contain F-plasmids, antibiotic resistance can be easily spread among a population of bacteria. Also, R-factors can be taken up by "DNA pumps" in their membranes via transformation, or less commonly through viral mediated transduction, or via bacteriophage, although conjugation is the most common means of antibiotic resistance spread. They contain the gene called RTF (Resistance transfer factor).
Enterobacteriaceae[edit]
 Escherichia coli bacteria on the right are sensitive to two beta-lactam antibiotics, and do not grow in the semi-circular regions surrounding the antibiotics. E. coli bacteria on the left are resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics, and grow next to one antibiotic (bottom) and are less inhibited by another antibiotic (top).Members of family Enterobacteriaceae, for example, Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae pose the biggest threat regarding plasmid-mediated resistance in hospital- and community-acquired infections.[1]
Beta-lactam resistance[edit]
Both narrow spectrum beta-lactamases (e.g. penicillinases) and extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) are common for resistance plasmids in Enterobacteriaceae. Often multiple beta-lactamase genes are found on the same plasmid hydrolyzing a wide spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics.[1]
Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL)[edit]
ESBL enzymes can hydrolyze all beta-lactam antibiotics, including cephalosporins, except for the carpabepenems. The first clinically observed ESBL enzymes were mutated versions of the narrow spectrum beta-lactamases, like TEM and SHV. Other ESBL enzymes originate outside of family Enterobacteriaceae, but have been spreading as well.[1]
In addition, since the plasmids that carry ESBL genes also commonly encode resistance determinants for many other antibiotics, ESBL strains are often resistant to many non-beta-lactam antibiotics as well,[6] leaving very few options for the treatment.
Carbapenemases[edit]
Carbapenemases represent type of ESBL which are able to hydrolyze carbapenem antibiotics that are considered as the last-resort treatment for ESBL-producing bacteria. KPC, NDM-1, VIM and OXA-48 carbapenemases have been increasingly reported worldwide as causes of hospital-acquired infections.[1]
Quinolone resistance[edit]
Quinolone resistance genes are frequently located on the same plasmid as the ESBL genes. Examples of resistance mechanisms include different Qnr proteins, aminoglycose acetyltransferase aac(6')-Ib-cr that is able to hydrolyze ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin, as well as efflux transporters OqxAB and QepA.[1]
Aminoglycoside resistance[edit]
Aminoglycoside resistance genes are also commonly found together with ESBL genes. Resistance to aminoglycosides is conferred via numerous aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes and 16S rRNA methyltransferases.[1]
small RNAs[edit]
Study investigating physiological effect of pHK01 plasmid in host E.coli J53 found that the plasmid reduced bacterial motility and conferred resistance to beta-lactams. The pHK01  produced plasmid-encoded  small RNAs and mediated expression of host sRNAs. These sRNAs were antisense to genes involved in replication, conjugate transfer and plasmid stabilisation : AS-repA3 (CopA), AS-traI, AS-finO, AS-traG, AS-pc02 . The over-expression of one of the plasmid-encoded antisense sRNAs: AS-traI shortened t lalog phase of host growth.[7]

Forrest Porter "Chubby" Grigg, Jr. (January 10, 1926 – October 10, 1983) was an American football tackle who played seven seasons in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) in the 1940s and 1950s. Grigg grew up in Texas and attended the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma. After graduating from college, he joined the AAFC's Buffalo Bisons, where he played for a year. Grigg was then sent to the Chicago Rockets in 1947, but stayed only one season before joining the Cleveland Browns in 1948. The Browns won all of their games and the AAFC championship that season. Cleveland again won the AAFC championship in 1949 before the league dissolved and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Grigg continued to play for the Browns in 1950 and 1951. The team won the NFL championship in 1950, and reached the title game but lost it the following year. Grigg spent a final season with the Dallas Texans before retiring from football.
After football, Grigg owned and ran a successful restaurant in Texas for 18 years, retiring in the early 1970s as his health began to falter. In late 1976, he was arrested after shooting and killing his son Michael, who was taking drugs and had been convicted of burglary the year before. Grigg was tried for the crime in 1977 and found guilty of involuntary manslaughter; he was sentenced to five years of probation. He died in 1983.

Early life and college[edit]
Grigg was born in El Dorado, Arkansas and attended Longview High School in Longview, Texas.[1] After graduating, he went to the University of Tulsa, where he was a member of a 1946 team that lost to the Georgia Bulldogs in the 1946 Oil Bowl, 20-6.[2] Grigg recovered a fumble on Georgia's 13-yard line to set up Tulsa's only score of the game.[2]
Professional career[edit]
After college, Grigg signed with the Buffalo Bisons of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC).[3] Vying for a spot as a tackle, Grigg weighed in at 330 pounds.[3] He played in the first games of the season for the Bisons in 1946, but was benched in September because of his weight.[4] As a joke at practice, Buffalo coach Red Dawson occasionally told players to "take two laps around Grigg".[4] Grigg attempted to get his weight down to 300 pounds, but was unable to do so. He returned to the lineup for an October game against the Chicago Rockets, and the Bills finished the season with a 3–10 win–loss record.[4][5] During training camp in 1949, Grigg and teammate Ben Pucci were sold to the Rockets.[6]
Grigg played one year for the Rockets before being traded along with Alex Agase to the Cleveland Browns, a team that had won the first two AAFC championships.[7] Grigg played as a defensive tackle as the Browns won all of their games in 1948 and a third straight league championship.[8] Cleveland won the championship again in 1949, but the AAFC dissolved after the season and the Browns were absorbed by the more established National Football League (NFL).[9] Grigg continued to struggle with his weight while with the Browns. In 1948, head coach Paul Brown gave him a $500 bonus for weighing in at 278 pounds before the season.[10] Grigg, however, ballooned to 317 pounds by the end of the year.[10] The following season, Brown gave him another $500 for coming to camp at 275 pounds and promised him an additional $500 to keep the weight off for the rest of the season.[10]
In 1950, Cleveland's first season in the NFL, the team finished with a 10–2 record and advanced to the championship game against the Los Angeles Rams.[11] The Browns won the game 30–28 on a last-minute field goal by placekicker Lou Groza.[12] Grigg later said blocking for Groza as he made the kick was the highlight of his career.[13] Grigg stayed with the Browns for the 1951 season, when the team again reached the championship game but lost to the Rams.[14] He was acquired by the Green Bay Packers in 1952, but was picked up by the Dallas Texans early in the season on waivers.[15] Grigg played a final season for the Texans before leaving football.[16]
Later life and death[edit]
After his playing career ended, Grigg owned and operated a successful restaurant in Ore City, Texas that was well known in Upshur County for its catfish.[17] He sold the business after 18 years in 1972 and retired.[13] By then, he was suffering from diabetes and living off of a disability pension and social security.[13] "I have sugar diabetes and a few other things that go with it", he said then.[13]
Grigg was arrested in November 1976 for shooting and killing his 20-year-old son Michael.[17] Michael had been convicted the previous year of burglary and was serving a five-year probation sentence at the time.[17] Police were called in and found Michael on the family's living room floor with a bullet in his head.[17] Grigg was released on $50,000 bond.[17] The following year, he was indicted and tried for murder. His son had been taking drugs including marijuana and valium, Grigg said, and he felt the boy could not be helped.[18] "I tried everything", he said in 1977. "I thought we'd get him straight, and then he'd start again. He'd get a job, then quit and spend the money on this stuff."[18] The jury in Grigg's murder trial was deadlocked 9 to 3; he changed his plea to guilty of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to five years of probation.[18] Michael had changed because of the drugs, Grigg said, quitting his sports activities and losing his ambitions.[18] He was kicked out of high school because his hair was too long.[18] Grigg died in Ore City on October 10, 1983.[19]

Personal detailsAlma materUniversity of Toledo
Jeanette Semeleer is an Aruban economist who has been the president of the Central Bank of Aruba since 2008.[1]
As president of the bank, Semeleer oversaw a seven-year enterprise to redesign the Aruban florin banknotes in partnership with Crane Currency. The new banknotes, first issued in 2019, are decorated with the indigenous plants and animals of Aruba.[2][3] The International Bank Note Society designated the new 100 florin as the "Banknote of the Year for 2019".[4][5]
Semeleer joined the CBA in 1990, eventually leading several of its departments and becoming a member of its board in 2000. Before the CBA, she served as an advisor for Aruba's Department of Economic Affairs as well as the Department of Foreign Relations. She is a 1984 graduate of the University of Toledo, where she studied economics.[6]

Thunder win a second grand final. Surrey make third grand final appearance in four years.Date26 April 2014VenueUniversity of Worcester Arena, Worcester[1]Player of the MatchHelen Housby (Manchester Thunder) [2]← 2013 2015 → 
The 2014 Netball Superleague Grand Final featured Manchester Thunder and Surrey Storm. This was the second grand final featuring Thunder and Storm. The two teams previously met in the 2012 grand final which Thunder won by two points. After winning the regular season without losing a match, Storm, with a team featuring player/coach Tamsin Greenway and Rachel Dunn, started the final as favourites. At half-time they were leading 26–22 and after three quarters were still ahead at 38–36. However Thunder, coached by Tracey Neville and featuring Sara Bayman, remained a threat throughout the match. With the score at 48–48 and twenty five seconds on the clock, pressure from Jodie Gibson saw Storm lose possession. Thunder pounced on a loose ball and fed it to Helen Housby who subsequently netted a very late winner.[1][3][4][5]

Scottish poet (1892–1978)
Hugh MacDiarmidA bust of MacDiarmid sculpted in 1927BornChristopher Murray Grieve11 August 1892 (1892-08-11)Langholm, Dumfriesshire, ScotlandDied9 September 1978(1978-09-09) (aged 86)Edinburgh, ScotlandOccupationPoetLiterary movementScottish Renaissance
Christopher Murray Grieve (11 August 1892 – 9 September 1978), best known by his pen name Hugh MacDiarmid (/məkˈdɜːrmɪd/), was a Scottish poet, journalist, essayist and political figure. He is considered one of the principal forces behind the Scottish Renaissance and has had a lasting impact on Scottish culture and politics. He was a founding member of the National Party of Scotland in 1928 but left in 1933 due to his Marxist–Leninist views. He joined the Communist Party the following year only to be expelled in 1938 for his nationalist sympathies. He would subsequently stand as a parliamentary candidate for both the Scottish National Party (1945) and British Communist Party (1964).
Grieve's earliest work, including Annals of the Five Senses, was written in English, but he is best known for his use of "synthetic Scots", a literary version of the Scots language that he himself developed. From the early 1930s onwards MacDiarmid made greater use of English, sometimes a "synthetic English" that was supplemented by scientific and technical vocabularies.
The son of a postman, MacDiarmid was born in the Scottish border town of Langholm, Dumfriesshire. He was educated at Langholm Academy before becoming a teacher for a brief time at Broughton Higher Grade School in Edinburgh. He began his writing career as a journalist in Wales,[1][2][3] contributing to the socialist newspaper The Merthyr Pioneer run by Labour party founder Keir Hardie[2] before joining the Royal Army Medical Corps at the outbreak of the First World War.[3] He served in Salonica, Greece and France before developing cerebral malaria and subsequently returning to Scotland in 1918. MacDiarmid's time in the army was influential in his political and artistic development.
After the war he continued to work as a journalist, living in Montrose where he became editor and reporter of the Montrose Review[4] as well as a justice of the peace and a member of the county council. In 1923 his first book, Annals of the Five Senses, was published at his own expense, followed by Sangschaw in 1925, and Penny Wheep. A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle, published in 1926, is generally regarded as MacDiarmid's most famous and influential work.[4]
Moving to the Shetland island of Whalsay in 1933 with his son Michael and second wife, Valda Trevlyn, MacDiarmid continued to write essays and poetry despite being cut off from mainland cultural developments for much of the 1930s.[3] He died at his cottage Brownsbank, near Biggar, in 1978 at the age of 86.[5]
Throughout his life MacDiarmid was a supporter of both communism and Scottish nationalism, views that often put him at odds with his contemporaries. He was a founding member of the National Party of Scotland,[3] forerunner to the modern Scottish National Party. He stood as a candidate for the Scottish National Party in 1945 and 1950, and for the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1964.[4] In 1949, MacDiarmid's opinions led George Orwell to include his name in a list of "those who should not be trusted"[6] to MI5. Today, MacDiarmid's work is credited with inspiring a new generation of writers. Fellow poet Edwin Morgan said of him: "Eccentric and often maddening genius he may be, but MacDiarmid has produced many works which, in the only test possible, go on haunting the mind and memory and casting Coleridgean seeds of insight and surprise."[1]

Biography[edit]
Early life[edit]
Grieve was born in Langholm in 1892.[7] His father was a postman; his family lived above the town library, giving MacDiarmid access to books from an early age. Grieve attended Langholm Academy and, from 1908, Broughton Junior Student Centre in Edinburgh, where he studied under George Ogilvie who introduced him to the magazine The New Age.  He left the school on 27 January 1911, following the theft of some books and postage stamps; his father died eight days later, on 3 February 1911.
Following Grieve's departure from Broughton, Ogilvie arranged for Grieve to be employed as a journalist with the Edinburgh Evening Dispatch. Grieve was to lose this job later in 1911, but on 20 July of that year he had his first article, "The Young Astrology" published in The New Age. In October 1911, Grieve moved to Ebbw Vale in Monmouthshire, Wales[8] where he worked as a newspaper reporter; by 1913 he had returned to Scotland and was working for the Clydebank and Renfrew Press in Clydebank, near Glasgow. It was here that Grieve first encountered the work of John Maclean, Neil Malcolm Maclean, and James Maxton.
First World War[edit]
In July 1915 Grieve left the town of Forfar in eastern Scotland and travelled to the Hillsborough barracks in Sheffield. He went on to serve in the Royal Army Medical Corps in Salonica, Greece and France during the First World War. After the war, he married and returned to journalism.
Return to Scotland[edit]
MacDiarmid's first book, Annals of the Five Senses, was a mixture of prose and poetry written in English, and was published in 1923 while MacDiarmid was living in Montrose. At about this time MacDiarmid turned to Scots for a series of books, culminating in what is probably his best known work, the book-length A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle. This poem is widely regarded as one of the most important long poems in 20th-century Scottish literature. After that, he published several books containing poems in both English and Scots.[citation needed]
Time in England[edit]
From 1929 to 1930 MacDiarmid lived in London, and worked for Compton Mackenzie's magazine, Vox. MacDiarmid lived in Liverpool from 1930 to 1931, before returning to London; he left again in 1932, and lived in the village of Thakeham in West Sussex until he returned to Scotland in 1932.
Whalsay, Shetland[edit]
MacDiarmid lived in Sodom[9] on the island of Whalsay, Shetland, from 1933 until 1942. He often asked the local fishermen to take him out in their boats and once asked them to leave him on an uninhabited island for a night and pick him up again in the morning. Local legend has it that he asked about Whalsay words and some of the Whalsay folk made up fantastical words that did not exist. The dialect is strong on the island and any strange words would have probably sounded quite plausible. "The often tormented genius wrote much of his finest poetry (including 'On a Raised Beach') and, via the Whalsay post office, conducted furious correspondence with the leading writers and thinkers of his generation."[10]
The croft house that was his Whalsay home was made into a camping böd, the Grieves House böd, run by Shetland Amenity Trust. But it is sadly in a state of disrepair and "closed for maintenance" as of 2022.[11]
Return to the Scottish Mainland[edit]
In 1942 MacDiarmid was directed to war work and moved to Glasgow, where he lived until 1949. Between 1949 and 1951 he lived in a cottage on the grounds of Dungavel House, Lanarkshire, before moving to his final home: "Brownsbank", a cottage in Candymill, near Biggar in the Scottish Borders. He died, aged 86, in Edinburgh.[12]
Politics[edit]
 Poster for Hugh MacDiarmid exhibition held at the National Library of Scotland in honour of his 75th birthday in 1967.
In 1928, MacDiarmid helped found the National Party of Scotland,[13] but was expelled during the 1930s.[14]
MacDiarmid was at times a member of the Communist Party of Great Britain, but he was expelled twice. John Baglow reports that "his comrades never really knew what to make of him."[15] Indeed, he was expelled from the Communist Party for being a Scottish Nationalist, and from the National Party of Scotland for being a Communist.[16] 
As a follower of the Scottish revolutionary socialist John Maclean, he saw no contradiction between international socialism and the nationalist vision of a Scottish workers' republic, but this ensured a fraught relationship with organised political parties.[17]
From 1931, whilst he was in London, until 1943, after he left the Shetland island of Whalsay, MacDiarmid was under surveillance by British military intelligence.[18] In 1949, George Orwell included MacDiarmid in his list for British Intelligence of fellow Leftist writers whom he suspected of sympathies for Joseph Stalin or direct links with the intelligence services of the USSR.
MacDiarmid stood in the Glasgow Kelvingrove constituency in the 1945 and 1950 general elections. He stood against the Conservative Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home in Kinross and Western Perthshire at the 1964 election, taking only 127 votes.
In 2010 letters were discovered showing that MacDiarmid believed the Nazi invasion of Britain (Operation Sea Lion) would benefit Scotland. In a letter sent from Whalsay, Shetland, in April 1941, he wrote: "On balance I regard the Axis powers, tho' more violently evil for the time being, less dangerous than our own government in the long run and indistinguishable in purpose."[19] A year earlier, in June 1940, he wrote: "Although the Germans are appalling enough, they cannot win, but the British and French bourgeoisie can and they are a far greater enemy. If the Germans win they could not hold their gain for long, but if the French and British win it will be infinitely more difficult to get rid of them".
Marc Horne in the Daily Telegraph commented: "MacDiarmid flirted with fascism in his early thirties, when he believed it was a doctrine of the left. In two articles written in 1923, Plea for a Scottish Fascism and Programme for a Scottish Fascism, he appeared to support Mussolini’s regime. By the 1930s, however, following Mussolini’s lurch to the right, his position had changed and he castigated Neville Chamberlain over his appeasement of Hitler’s expansionism."[20] In response, Deirdre Grieve, MacDiarmid's daughter-in-law and literary executor, noted: "I think he entertained almost every ideal it was possible to entertain at one point or another."[20]
Writing[edit]

Much of the work that MacDiarmid published in the 1920s was written in what he termed "Synthetic Scots": a version of the Scots language that "synthesised" multiple local dialects, which MacDiarmid constructed from dictionaries and other sources. From the 1930s onwards MacDiarmid found himself turning more and more to English as a means of expression so that most of his later poetry is written in that language. His ambition was to live up to Rilke's dictum that 'the poet must know everything' and to write a poetry that contained all knowledge. As a result, many of the poems in Stony Limits (1934) and later volumes are a kind of found poetry reusing text from a range of sources. Just as he had used John Jamieson's dialect dictionary for his poems in 'synthetic Scots', so he used Chambers Twentieth Century Dictionary for poems such as 'On a Raised Beach'.[21] Other poems, including 'On a Raised Beach' and 'Etika Preobrazhennavo Erosa' used extensive passages of prose.[22][23] This practice, particularly in the poem 'Perfect', led to accusations of plagiarism[24] from supporters of the Welsh poet Glyn Jones, to which MacDiarmid's response was 'The greater the plagiarism the greater the work of art.' The great achievement of this late poetry is to attempt on an epic scale to capture the idea of a world without God in which all the facts the poetry deals with are scientifically verifiable. In his critical work Lives of the Poets, Michael Schmidt notes that Hugh MacDiarmid 'had redrawn the map of Scottish poetry and affected the whole configuration of English literature'.[25]
MacDiarmid wrote a number of non-fiction prose works, including Scottish Eccentrics and his autobiography Lucky Poet. He also did a number of translations from Scottish Gaelic, including Duncan Ban MacIntyre's Praise of Ben Dorain, which were well received by native speakers including Sorley MacLean.
Personal life[edit]
He had a daughter, Christine, and a son, Walter, by his first wife Peggy Skinner. He had a son, James Michael Trevlyn, known as Michael, by his second wife Valda Trevlyn (1906-1989); Michael was a conscientious objector to post-World War II National Service and became vice chair of the Scottish National Party.
Places of interest[edit]
MacDiarmid grew up in the Scottish town of Langholm in Dumfriesshire. The town is home to a monument in his honour made of cast iron which takes the form of a large open book depicting images from his writings.[26]
MacDiarmid lived in Montrose for a time where he worked for the local newspaper the Montrose Review.[27]
MacDiarmid also lived on the isle of Whalsay in Shetland, in Sodom (Sudheim). The house is now one of Shetland's 'Camping Bods', offering basic, bothy-style accommodation to visitors.
Brownsbank Cottage, near Biggar, South Lanarkshire, the home of MacDiarmid and his wife Valda from 1952 until their deaths, has been restored by the Biggar Museum Trust.[28]
Hugh MacDiarmid is commemorated in Makars' Court, outside the Writers' Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. Selections for Makars' Court are made by the Writers' Museum, the Saltire Society and the Scottish Poetry Library.
Portrait in National Portrait Gallery primary collection and film portrait[edit]
Hugh MacDiarmid sat for sculptor Alan Thornhill and a bronze was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery.[29] The terracotta original is held in the collection of the artist.[30] The correspondence file relating to the MacDiarmid bust is held in the archive[31] of the Henry Moore Foundation's Henry Moore Institute in Leeds.
Filmmaker and poet Margaret Tait  made a film Hugh MacDiarmid, A Portrait (1964) [32] when the poet was seventy-one which novelist Ali Smith describes as ‘a model of versatility, a meld of voice and image each illuminating the other’.  The poems heard read by MacDiarmid are ‘You Know Not Who I Am’, ‘Somersault’, ‘Krang’ and some lines from ‘The Kind of Poetry I Want’.  Writing of MacDiarmid and Tait,[33] academic Sarah Neely notes ‘MacDiarmid was also a champion of Tait’s work as a film-maker and poet; he published a few of her poems and also organised a screening of her films at the Dunedin Society’.[34]

Drögen is a lake in Kinda and Linköping municipalities, Östergötland County in southeastern Sweden. The lake lies in sparsely populated area and is mostly surrounded by forests.[1] Common fish in the lake are Eurasian perch, northern pike, common bleak, vendace, burbot, tench, common bream and roach.[1] Occasionally European eel can be found while the local population of Arctic char (Swedish: storröding) has gone extinct.[1][2]

The Ulster American Folk Park is an open-air museum just outside Omagh, in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. With more than 30 exhibit buildings to explore, the museum tells the story of three centuries of Irish emigration. Using costumed guides and displays of traditional crafts, the museum focuses on those who left Ulster for America in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The museum is part of National Museums Northern Ireland.[3][4]
Within the museum there are many restored, original buildings with connections to local families. The park was developed around the Mellon House, the birthplace of Irish-American banker and lawyer Thomas Mellon, founding father of the Mellon banking dynasty. This house and its outbuildings remain in their original location. Visitors can taste samples of traditional Irish and pioneer American foods including freshly baked soda bread and pumpkin pie all made on the hearths and griddles of the exhibit buildings. The museum also includes agricultural displays and an array of farm animals.
The park is open throughout the year, excluding some public holidays.

Theme[edit]
The demonstrations that take place showcase the day-to-day tasks and skills of those who lived in the era such as blacksmithing, candle-dipping, embroidery, spinning, printing, and open hearth cooking. The museum runs a lively programme of events and exhibitions that connect to their collections. The museum has also hosted many international exhibitions in recent years including Fighting Irishmen from the Irish Arts Center in New York which showcased the influence of Irish emigrants in the sport of boxing, and Warriors of the Plains from the British Museum, which explored the Indigenous peoples of North America. Special events mark the culture of both the New World and the Old World, such as U.S. Independence Day, Halloween, Easter and of course Saint Patrick's Day. The melting pot of emigrant music is celebrated with a three-day Bluegrass Music Festival every September.
The museum's visitor centre houses a cafe and shop as well as the permanent exhibition Emigrants that introduces the story of emigration from Ireland to America, before visitors embark on their journey around the outdoor museum and along the emigrant trail. Free parking is available on site.

Sections[edit]
Research and education[edit]
The entrance section includes a restaurant, a visitors' information centre and the Centre for Migration Studies (CMS). The CMS has an attached library and offers, in conjunction with the University of Ulster and Queen's University of Belfast, postgraduate and undergraduate courses, as well as tailored and shorter courses; all of the courses concern the study of Irish migration from 1600 to the present day. The specialist research library contains some 10,000 volumes, over 50 periodicals, maps, audio-visual material, and a collection of primary source documents (the Irish Emigration Database) which is searchable on computer. The centre is open to visitors during basic office hours, and closed during public holidays.
Old World[edit]

The Old World region includes whole streets of original houses, an original printing press, a bank, an old police barracks, the old Castletown National School, and two churches. Central to this region is the boyhood home of Thomas Mellon, judge and founder of the Pittsburgh banking dynasty.
Some of the two-up, two-down houses in one of the reconstructed streets in the park were transported, in their entirety, from Sandy Row, off the Donegall Road in Belfast, and other buildings have been transported from elsewhere in the province.
New World[edit]
Linking the Old and New World sections of the park is the Ship and Dockside gallery, which includes the Brig Union, a full-size replica of an immigrant sailing ship.
The historic atmosphere continues in the New World area, which features a recreated old American street with a tinsmith display and the original interior of a Virginia general store. Beyond the street, the frontier journey begins with a stop at the 1720s Fulton stone house, painstakingly dismantled in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, and rebuilt here. Other original frontier houses in the park include an Appalachian log house from Washington county, Pennsylvania, the 1830 West Virginia home of Richard McCallister, removed from Cabell county, and a brick plantation house built by Francis Rogan in the early 19th century near Nashville, Tennessee.

Premise[edit]
Caitlin's Way focuses on Caitlin Seeger (played by Lindsay Felton), a troubled girl who lives on the streets of Philadelphia. After being arrested, Caitlin is given the option of going to a youth detention center or moving in with her mother Katherine's cousin in Montana during her meeting with a judge. She chooses the latter; upon moving in with Dori, Jim, and Griffen on their ranch, she experiences culture shock. Caitlin, still distraught about her mother Katherine's unexpected death when Caitlin was eight, seeks a loving family and a permanent home. The ranch was actually near High River in southeastern Alberta, Canada. There were scenes shot in town (around the many murals, as well as in local schools), and in Calgary where the C-Train was occasionally seen in the background.
Characters[edit]
Main characters[edit]
Caitlin Seeger
Played by Lindsay Felton
Caitlin Seeger is a 14-year-old girl who has been in and out of foster homes since age eight, when her mother Katherine suddenly died. Her father had left when she was four. Caitlin, still angry about her mother's death, hides her grief in her tough-girl persona and gets into trouble frequently. She loves photography and is usually seen with her camera which once belonged to her mother. Her dream is to become a professional photographer. After getting in trouble and expelled from her Catholic school, Caitlin is given the option of going to a juvenile detention facility or going to live with her mother Katherine's cousin Dori Lowe (whom Caitlin did not even know existed), her husband Jim and their son Griffen in Montana by the judge that she meets with. Caitlin agrees to go to Montana. While there, she meets and rescues a stallion from wranglers whom she names Bandit. As time goes by, the Lowes and Caitlin learn to accept each other and Caitlin gets what she's always wanted for a long time: a loving family and a permanent home. She loves to read and her best subject in school is English; her worst is math. The locket that Caitlin wears 24/7 is the same locket that her mother used to wear and she is often seen listening to her mini CD player. Caitlin used to play soccer and she associates the sport with her mom because the last time Caitlin played soccer with her best friend was the day that her mom Katherine died. Caitlin's favorite color is black.
Dori Lowe
Played by Cynthia Belliveau
Dori Lowe is Jim's wife, Griffin's mom, the cousin of Caitlin's mother Katherine, and a veterinarian. She suggests that Caitlin come to live with them. Dori told Caitlin once that she and her mother never really had much contact which is why they did not know about her until recently. She has a home office and works with most of the animals there are in High River. As a loving mother, Dori tries to warm up to Caitlin by acting like her mother figure, which has at times Caitlin resents since she doesn't want anybody taking her mom's place and causes her to push Dori away at times and has even hurt her feelings with things she has said about her. Caitlin eventually learned the truth about her mother's death from Dori who tells her she died from an Aneurysm that killed her instantly. Caitlin breaks down over hearing this and Dori says she assumed that Caitlin knew. Caitlin admits to her that nobody had ever told her. The two eventually become closer throughout the show and Caitlin finally accepts Dori as her new mother figure after Dori explains that she wants to be a mother to Caitlin, but not be one that replaces her own mother. In high school, Dori was on the girls' soccer team but wasn't very good so she Dori had to work particularly hard to stay on the team.
Jim Lowe
Played by Ken Tremblett
Jim Lowe is Dori's husband, Griffin's father, and the local sheriff. Caitlin sees him as the only strong father figure she has had in her entire life since her own father left her. Jim is a loving father and husband, always willing to help his family out whenever they need him. When Caitlin first comes to live with them, the two of them feel awkward around each other, but they eventually come past that. Jim loves Caitlin as his if she was his own daughter and does whatever he can to help her.
Griffen Lowe
Played by Jeremy Foley
Griffen Lowe is the 14-year-old son of Jim and Dori and Caitlin's second cousin. He is a very smart kid, always earning straight A's. Griffen's hobbies include computers, riding his bike, playing the guitar, and singing in a band with his best friends Brett and Eric called Bad Hygiene. When he first learned that Caitlin would come to live with them, he wasn't too happy about it. The two of them often get into fights and Griffen will usually make cruel remarks about her past to anger Caitlin. Despite all the arguing, they eventually form a brother and sister like relationship and become each other's best friends. They will always help each other out, no matter what the situation is or how much trouble they get into. He is often the voice of reason for Caitlin and he's always there to give advice to her and has admitted to her that he never likes it when she is sad, but is always there to comfort her.
Bandit
Bandit is a wild Buckskin stallion whom Caitlin helps rescue from wranglers who soon later rescues her from a rabid wolf and the two soon bond. He belongs to Caitlin as of "Stray Part 3." Dori allows her to keep him after Bandit doesn't show any signs of Rabies. Caitlin decides to name him Bandit, after a horse that was in a story her mother used to read to her when she was little. Except when she's grounded, Caitlin usually rides Bandit every day. In "The Present Part 1" Will and Sarah thinking Bandit was their colt that ran away almost took him from Caitlin, but in "The Present Part 2" Will sees how much Caitlin loves him and that she has given him a good home and allows her to keep him. Bandit almost died at the end of Season 1 after he got his leg caught in a rusty old bear trap, but Dori saved his life.
Cousin
Cousin is Griffen's dog. He's very friendly and loves everybody. During "Making Allowances," when Caitlin brought Cousin into the store, he caused a ruckus. After Season 1, Cousin isn't seen or mentioned again.
Alfalfa
Alfalfa is Caitlin's Calico cat. Dori comes up with Alfalfa's name while she's bottle feeding her after she's born. We meet her in Season 2. In Season 3, Caitlin decides to give Alfalfa to Ruth to replace her cat Mortimer, but when she gets to Ruth's house, she finds her dead and as a result she gets to keep her kitten.
Secondary characters[edit]
Brett Stevens
Played by Stephen Warner
Brett Stevens is Griffen's best friend. He plays the bass in their band "Bad Hygiene" and is on the basketball team at High River High School. He has a little sister named Julie and a girlfriend named Taylor. Brett and Taylor broke up twice, but eventually got back together for good in Season 2. His dream is to play in the NBA after he graduates from high school. Like Griffen and Eric, Brett loves riding his bike.
Taylor Langford
Played by Tania Saulnier
Taylor Langford is Brett's girlfriend, Caitlin's rival but in a few episodes they both bond a little bit, and Griffen's main love interest during Season 1. Taylor's on the cheerleading squad and the girls' soccer team and is perhaps the biggest snob at High River High School. Taylor and her mother had won the mother-daughter horse race every year until Caitlin and Dori broke their streak. She is a complicated character: In "All About Caitlin," we learn that Taylor changes best friends every week and that her father doesn't give her enough love. Her goal in life is to be an entertainment lawyer. Taylor and Griffen become friends in "All About Caitlin". Taylor just wants Caitlin to be normal. Taylor's favorite color is pink.
Eric Anderson
Played by Brendan Fletcher
Eric Anderson is Griffen's other best friend and Caitlin's other rival. Eric plays the drums in their band "Bad Hygiene," and he's on the High River High School football team. Griffin has known Eric since kindergarten. Like Taylor, he is a complicated character: it is inferred that he acts like a jerk because his father is always putting him down. His dream is to own a cattle ranch and maybe open up a Cow Boy themed restaurant after graduation. Like Griffen and Brett, Eric loves riding his bike.
Annie
Played by Julianna Enciu
Annie is Caitlin's new best friend and Griffen's new main love interest. We meet her in "Caitlin's First Dance". At first, Annie is visiting High River for the weekend, but then she and her family ultimately move to High River. Annie takes Caitlin's place as the new kid at High River High School. Annie loves horses and she was going to take lessons with her best friend Janet before she moved to High River. Annie's good at dancing. Annie works as a part-time Waitress at the diner. Caitlin filled in for Annie once so that she could attend her cousin's wedding. When Annie meets Caitlin, she befriends her and she's the only one who likes Caitlin and accepts her for who she is. After Season 1, Annie isn't seen or mentioned again.
Julie Stevens
Played by Alexandra Purvis
Episodes: "Little Sister" and "All About Caitlin"
Julie Stevens is Brett's little sister, whose dream is to do Barrel racing. She has an American Paint Horse named Patches. Julie's parents almost sold Patches because his upkeep was so expensive, and Julie was heartbroken at the thought of losing Patches forever. Caitlin helped arrange for Patches to be boarded at the Lowe Ranch. As a result, Julie looks up to Caitlin and thinks she is cool. After "All About Caitlin," Julie isn't seen again and after "Solo," Julie isn't mentioned again.
Jordan Clarke
Played by Sean Amsing
Jordan Clarke is one of Caitlin's friends. We meet him in Season 1. Jordan loves to play basketball and he's good at rapping. Jordan became hooked on rap when he went to a football game with his mom when he was five. Jordan saw some break dancers during half time so he jumped out of his seat and tried to mimick their moves. Then Jordan fell and knocked out three of his teeth. He wants to be a rapper when he grows up. In "The Present Part 2" at school the next day when it seems that Caitlin's going to lose Bandit forever Jordan performs a Birthday Rap that he wrote for Caitlin to cheer her up.
Nikki
Played by Alana Husband
Season 2 – Season 3
Nikki is Griffen's ex-girlfriend. They got together in Season 2, but they broke up in "Juliet & Her Romeo," because they never hung out anymore due to Griffen constantly hanging out with Brett and Eric. However, Nikki and Griffen are still friends. She plays the clarinet in the High River High School band.
Will Findlay
Played by Jason McSkimming
Season 2 – Season 3
Will Findlay is Caitlin's main love interest and a misunderstood bad boy. He is introduced in "The Present Part 1". He and Caitlin share a lot in common (loss of a parent, moved around a lot, etc.) His mother, Sarah is a mean snob that often neglects Will. Will has a new horse named Sinbad. Will dated Taylor for a little while to get back at Caitlin for doing the right thing after they ruined Eric's crop when Will talked Caitlin into skipping Summer school after she failed math. Will's best subject in school is math. Caitlin helped Will change after his motorcycle accident when he admitted to her that he'd hurt Sarah emotionally to get back at her for not being there for him. In "Burned," Caitlin and Will kiss for the first time. Due to the series being cancelled after 3 seasons, we'll never know if Caitlin and Will became a couple.
Garth Crowchild
Played by Nathaniel Arcand
Season 1
Garth is Jim's Native American assistant and his best friend. Garth is one of the local Cops in High River.

After a fight with Caitlin when he missed the Father – Daughter hockey tournament, he almost left High River, but the two of them eventually made things right.

Michael Vadbolsky (Russian: Михаил Николаевич Вадбольский; Georgian: მიხეილ ვადბოლსკი; 1899–1990) was a painter, writer and researcher of chess history who contributed to the development of the Georgian Chess School. Born in Warsaw, he studied painting in Saint Petersburg.
During the Civil war in Russia Vadbolsky's family was killed and Michael decided to settle in Georgia.
Vadbolsky took an interest in Georgian emblems and the history of their creation. He painted the portraits of historical people of Georgia, Armenia and old Eastern countries.
He also discovered Georgian historical patrimonial flags and emblems and found the signatures of Georgian political and public figures and examples of Georgian money and cloth. He recovered these materials from the museums of Tbilisi, Moscow and Petersburg, from gravestones, from the walls of Georgian churches and monasteries, and from miniatures of manuscripts. 
In 1981, Vadbolsky received the title of Honored Painter.

Procés Constituent (English: "Constituent Process") is a Catalan social movement, launched on 10 April 2013.[1] It is anti-capitalist and pro-Catalan independence, calling for 'A Republic of the 99%'.[2]

Origins[edit]
The initial founders of Procés Constituent were economist and activist, Arcadi Oliveres, and medical doctor and nun, Teresa Forcades, who launched the initiative by publishing a Manifesto: call for a constituent process in Catalonia.[3] More than 10,000 signed the manifesto in the first week.[4]
Electoral participation[edit]
Procés Constituent stood with Barcelona en Comú in the May 2015 municipal elections in Barcelona. Procés Constituent members Gerardo Pisarello and Jaume Asens were both elected to the city council to form part of the new government.
After negotiations, Procés Constituent decided not to stand with Catalunya Sí que es Pot or the Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP) in the 2015 Catalan parliamentary elections.[5]

Options for nuclear decommissioning of a shut down plant in the United States
SAFSTOR is a nuclear decommissioning method in which a nuclear power plant or facility governed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, is "placed and maintained in a condition that allows the facility to be safely stored and subsequently decontaminated (deferred decontamination) to levels that permit release for unrestricted use".[1]
During SAFSTOR the de-fuelled plant is monitored for up to sixty years before complete decontamination and dismantling of the site, to a condition where nuclear licensing is no longer required. During the storage interval, some of the radioactive contaminants of the reactor and power plant will decay, which will reduce the quantity of radioactive material to be removed during the final decontamination phase.
The other options set by the NRC are nuclear decommissioning which is immediate dismantling of the plant and remediation of the site, and nuclear entombment which is the enclosure of contaminated parts of the plant in a permanent layer of concrete.[2] Mixtures of options may be used, for example, immediate removal of steam turbine components and condensers, and SAFSTOR for the more heavily radioactive containment vessel. Since NRC requires decommissioning to be completed within 60 years, ENTOMB is not usually chosen since not all activity will have decayed to an unregulated background level in that time.
Decommissioning options for a retired nuclear plant may be chosen based on availability of decommissioning funds, operation of other reactors at the same site, or availability of waste disposal facilities. In 2004, 11 reactors were planned for DECON and 9 for SAFSTOR. In 2008, 14 shutdown commercial power reactors were planned for or had completed DECON, 11 were in SAFSTOR, 3 were in ENTOMB[3] and Three Mile Island unit 2 was defuelled and will be decontaminated when Unit 1 ceases operation.
Levels[edit]
Different sub-levels of SAFSTOR are recognized, which vary in the type of activity and monitoring required.[4]
In "hot/cold standby" the plant is kept in operating condition but not actively delivering power; monitoring and maintenance is similar to that during a long outage. This may be the first step to allow planning of further shutdown and decommissioning.
In "custodial SAFSTOR" systems such as radiation monitoring and ventilation are kept in operation, along with continuous site security and maintenance. Minimal initial decontamination is done.
"Passive SAFSTOR" requires a more thorough initial clean up, but allows only intermittent inspection of the site and shutdown of active systems such as radiation monitoring.
"Hardened SAFSTOR" prevents intrusion on contaminated parts of the plant by substantial barriers.
All varieties of SAFSTOR require positive action to decontaminate the site at the end of the storage period.

Hexaquark

Hypothetical particles made up of six quarks or antiquarks
In particle physics hexaquarks, alternatively known as sexaquarks,[1] are a large family of hypothetical particles, each particle consisting of six quarks or antiquarks of any flavours. Six constituent quarks in any of several combinations could yield a colour charge of zero; for example a hexaquark might contain either six quarks, resembling two baryons bound together (a dibaryon), or three quarks and three antiquarks.[2]  Once formed, dibaryons are predicted to be fairly stable by the standards of particle physics. 
A number of experiments have been suggested to detect dibaryon decays and interactions.  In the 1990s, several candidate dibaryon decays were observed but they were not confirmed.[3][4][5]
There is a theory that strange particles such as hyperons[6] and dibaryons[7] could form in the interior of a neutron star, changing its mass–radius ratio in ways that might be detectable. Accordingly, measurements of neutron stars could set constraints on possible dibaryon properties.[8] A large fraction of the neutrons in a neutron star could turn into hyperons and merge into dibaryons during the early part of its collapse into a black hole[citation needed]. These dibaryons would very quickly dissolve into quark–gluon plasma during the collapse, or go into some currently unknown state of matter.

D-star hexaquark[edit]
In 2014, a potential dibaryon was detected at the Jülich Research Center at about 2380 MeV. The center claimed that the measurements confirm results from 2011, via a more replicable method.[9][10] The particle existed for 10−23 seconds and was named d*(2380).[11] This particle is hypothesized to consist of three up and three down quarks, and has been proposed as a candidate for dark matter.[12][13][14]
It is theorized that groups of d-star particles could form Bose–Einstein condensates due to prevailing low temperatures in the early universe, a state in which they overlap and blend together, a bit like the protons and neutrons inside atoms. Under the right conditions, BECs made of hexaquarks with trapped electrons could behave like dark matter.[15] According to the researchers, this result indicates that during the earliest moments after the Big Bang, as the cosmos slowly cooled, stable d*(2830) hexaquarks could have formed alongside baryonic matter, and the production rate of this particle would have been sufficient to account for the 85% of the Universe's mass that is believed to be Dark Matter.[16]
Critics say that even if it is possible to create a d* condensate as proposed, it cannot survive the intense radiation of the early Universe. Once they are blasted apart, there is no way to create more d* particles capable of forming a Bose-Einstein condensate, as the conditions that admit their creation will have passed.[17]
H dibaryon[edit]
In 1977, Robert Jaffe proposed that a possibly stable H dibaryon with the quark composition udsuds could notionally result from the combination of two uds hyperons.[18] Calculations have shown that this particle is light and  (meta)stable. It actually takes more than twice the age of the universe to decay. Data constrains the existence of such a particle, and it turns out that it is still allowed.[1][19][20][21][22][23] As per one analysis, a hypothetical SU(3) flavor-singlet, highly symmetric, deeply bound neutral scalar hexaquark S=uuddss, which due to its features has escaped from experimental detection so far, may be considered as a candidate for a baryonic dark matter. However, existence of this state may contradict the stability of oxygen nuclei, necessitating further thorough analysis of it.[24]

 HMS Calliope passing USS Trenton whilst making for open sea, during the Apia cyclone
Admiral Sir Henry Coey Kane KCB (3 December 1843[1] – 30 January 1917) was a Royal Navy officer.
He was the second son of Sir Robert Kane, the Irish chemist, and entered the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1853 having been educated at St. Vincent's College, Castleknock, County Dublin (Castleknock College). He was promoted to captain in 1882, Rear-Admiral in 1897, and Admiral in 1907.
He saw active service during the 1882 Anglo-Egyptian War, and from 1883 to 1887 he was a Naval Attaché. In 1887 he was appointed to command the new cruiser HMS Calliope in the Pacific, and after service in China and Australia was sent to Samoa to watch over a growing international crisis there. This posting is generally remembered for a remarkable act of seamanship; when Calliope was in harbour, the island was struck by a powerful cyclone. Of the eleven ships present, only Calliope was able to successfully escape the harbour and ride out the cyclone at sea; the others were beached or wrecked, with over two hundred lives lost.
He was later made CB in the Queen's Birthday Honours for 1891, and given command of HMS Duke of Wellington that year. In 1894, he was appointed as the Director of Naval Ordnance, holding the office until 1897. He retired from the Navy in 1899, and made a Knight Commander of the Bath in 1911.

U.S. Route 2 (US 2) is a part of the United States Numbered Highway System that is split into two segments, one between Washington state and Michigan and the other between New York state and Maine. In New Hampshire, US 2 runs 35.437 miles (57.030 km) from the Vermont state line at the Connecticut River in Lancaster east to the Maine state line in Shelburne. US 2 is the main highway through the White Mountains across southern Coös County, where it also passes through Jefferson, Randolph, and Gorham. US 2 is the main connection between the Coös county seat of Lancaster, where the highway intersects US 3, and the county's largest city, Berlin, via its connection with New Hampshire Route 16 (NH 16) in Gorham.

Route description[edit]
 Westbound US 2 in Shelburne
US 2 enters Lancaster, New Hampshire, by crossing the Connecticut River from the town of Guildhall in Essex County, Vermont. The highway heads east from the bridge into Lancaster along Bridge Street. At the east end of Bridge Street, US 2 meets US 3 (Main Street) at a three-legged roundabout, immediately north of which is the historic Wilder-Holton House. The two U.S. Highways head southeast along Main Street through the Lancaster town center. The routes pass the Coös County Courthouse, the William Dennis Weeks Memorial Library, and the town's historic post office. At the south end of downtown Lancaster, US 2 and US 3 cross the Israel River and meet the north end of NH 135 (Elm Street). The two U.S. highways then diverge at an oblique intersection, US 3 on Prospect Street and US 2 on Portland Street.[3]
US 2 heads southeast out of the flat northern Connecticut Valley and into the rolling White Mountain foothills.[4] The highway parallels a state-owned rail line through the valley of the Israel River out of Lancaster and into the village of Riverton in Jefferson, where the highway and rail line cross obliquely at grade and the highway, now named Presidential Highway, crosses the river. US 2 ascends along the south flank of Mount Starr King toward the town center of Jefferson.[3] The route passes Santa's Village and meets the north end of NH 116 (Bailey Road).[5] East of the town center, US 2 meets the north end of NH 115A (Meadows Road) and passes the Waumbek Cottages Historic District. The highway passes through the hamlet of Starr King, crosses Priscilla Brook and Stag Hollow Brook, and meets the east end of NH 115 (Owls Head Highway) at the hamlet of Jefferson Highland.[5]
US 2 continues into the town of Randolph and into the White Mountains proper; the highway runs along the hillside above the Israel River between the Crescent Range to the north and the Presidential Range to the south.[4][6] The route crosses from the headwaters of the Israel River to the valley of the Moose River at the village of Bowman. US 2 crosses the Moose River several times as it passes through the town center of Randolph.[7] The highway leaves the Moose River and ascends along the southeast flank of Mount Crescent.[8] US 2 then enters the town of Gorham and descends back into the Moose River valley along Lancaster Road. At the bottom of the hill, the route crosses the state-owned Presidential Rail Trail,[9] passes a truck escape ramp, and meets the east end of Jimtown Road, which leads to Moose Brook State Park. The highway follows the low ridge between Moose Brook and the Moose River and intersects the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad at grade before reaching its junction with NH 16 (Main Street).
US 2 and NH 16 follow Main Street through the town center of Gorham, where the two highways crosses the Moose River just west of its confluence with the Androscoggin River. At the east end of town, NH 16 splits south onto Glen Road and US 2 crosses the Peabody River shortly before its oblique at-grade intersection with the railroad.[10] US 2 follows the valley of the Androscoggin River into the town of Shelburne; the valley passes between the Carter-Moriah Range to the south and the Mahoosuc Range to the north. The highway crosses the Rattle River and then Clement Brook in the town center of Shelburne. US 2 parallels the railroad across Connor Brook, just east of which the highway enters the town of Gilead in Oxford County, Maine.[11]
All of US 2 in New Hampshire is part of the National Highway System as a principal arterial.[12]

Before the Partition of India in 1947, about 584 princely states, also called "native states", existed in India,[1] which were not fully and formally part of British India, the parts of the Indian subcontinent which had not been conquered or annexed by the British but under indirect rule, subject to subsidiary alliances.
Things moved quickly after the partition of British India in 1947. By the end of 1949, all of the states had chosen to accede to one of the newly independent states of India or Pakistan or else had been conquered and annexed.

Outline[edit]
 Chamber of Princes meeting in 1941
Main article: Princely state
For details of precedence between the states, see Salute state.
In principle, the princely states had internal autonomy, while by treaty the British Crown had suzerainty and was responsible for the states' external affairs. In practice, while the states were indeed ruled by potentates with a variety of titles, such as Maharaja, Raja, Nizam, Raje, Deshmukh, Nawab, Mirza, Baig, Chhatrapati, Khan, Thakur Sahab, Darbar saheb or specially Jam for Jadeja/Samma, the British still had considerable influence.
By the time of the departure of the British in 1947, only four of the largest of the states still had their own British Resident, a diplomatic title for advisors present in the states' capitals, while most of the others were grouped together into Agencies, such as the Central India Agency, the Deccan States Agency, and the Rajputana Agency.
From 1920, the states were represented in the Chamber of Princes, which held its meetings in New Delhi.
The most important states were ranked as salute states, whose rulers were entitled to a given number of salute guns.
By the Indian Independence Act 1947, the British gave up their suzerainty of the states and left each of them free to choose whether to join one of the newly independent countries of India and Pakistan or to remain outside them. For a short time, some of the rulers explored the possibility of a federation of the states separate from either, but this came to nothing. Most of the states then decided to accede to India or to Pakistan, such as Junagadh (1947–1948), Hyderabad on 18 September 1948, Bilaspur on 12 October 1948, and Bhopal on 1 May 1949. Travancore also chose to remain an independent country.
In Jammu and Kashmir, a state with a Muslim majority but a Hindu ruler, the Maharaja hoped to remain independent but acceded to India on 27 October 1947 at the outset of the invasion of Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan — leading to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.
On 31 March 1948, Kalat acceded to Pakistan, although the brother of the Khan led a rebellion against this decision.

 Darda, German toy car
Darda is the name of a German toy car racing set (and related items) which was most popular in Europe and the USA throughout the 1980s and '90s.
The unique selling point of the sets is the special Darda Motor, invented by Helmut Darda in 1970, which propelled the cars (similarly sized to Matchbox or Hot Wheels) at speeds of up to 30 mph (50 km/h). The pullback motor is wound up by pressing down the rear of the car and rolling it forwards and backwards on its wheels.[1] Whilst winding the car up the motor clicks and once fully wound the tone of clicks deepens to signify that it can be wound no more.
The cars can be run on any surface but are designed to be run on special Darda tracks which can be bought as sets or individual track pieces. The tracks incorporate loops, jumps, curves and crossovers, and can be combined into quite elaborate creations including multi-level loops and Y-shaped return curves.
As with Hot Wheels and Matchbox, a range of cars is available. As Darda was originally a German company, many of the cars were based on German brands such as VW and Porsche. Various special cars were also created including a dragster and a mouse (which could not run on the Darda tracks as it was too wide). Another variant available in the late '80s was a replica KITT (Knight Industries Two Thousand) from the US television series Knight Rider. Recent models have included custom NASCAR racers, patrol cars from a variety of police forces including the New York Police Department, and a series of mounted collectible cars.
In the late '80s a new version of the Darda motor was introduced, called the Darda-Stop motor (later renamed to the Darda Stop-n-Go motor), it allowed the motor to be locked once wound so that the car could be placed on the track without immediately setting off. This allowed for longer tracks and 'tag-team' relay style racing where once the first car had gone round the track and just run out of power, it would tap the back of the wound up one and set it going. Ultraspeed cars, with lightweight plastic bodies rather than die-cast ones, were also introduced.
Darda products were packaged in a distinctive yellow and green packaging; today the color scheme has shifted to grays, blacks and blues.

Synopsis[edit]
One evening two mysterious men pull up outside of Jeannie's apartment and produce a (rather far fetched) remote control device which causes various items of furniture in her apartment to levitate and start moving around the room violently (akin to a poltergeist visitation). Terrified, Jeannie calls Jeff and runs out into the street. The two men leave the scene with a satisfied look on their face.
The next morning the two men pay Jeannie a visit and reveal themselves to be two brothers, Henry and George Foster, working in the 'spiritualism' business. Preying on Jeannie's heightened state they offer her a job, paying much more handsomely than her current position with Jeff and telling her how her skills as a Private Detective's P.A. are much valued by the pair.
She tells Jeff about the two men and how she is seriously considering their offer, telling him about her disenchantment with the Private Detective business. Jeff is sceptical and advises her to 'let it ride'. However, Jeannie visits the Fosters that evening to give them her answer. Upon arrival she is greeted by a display of items of furniture flying around the room and Henry tells her that it is the spirit of her dead husband trying to communicate with her. However, Marty is present at the time and realises immediately that something phoney is going on, though he has no answers to explain the mobile furniture! Jeannie leaves the Foster's residence without committing entirely to the job offer, though she is very tempted by the remuneration package and the offer of the Fosters to communicate with Marty.
Meanwhile, in an effort to convince Jeannie that the business can pay, Jeff is busy pawning some very valuable possessions to raise £250 which he passes on to an (out of work) actress friend called Laura Watson. Ms Watson is a stooge for Jeff's plans and he sends Jeannie round to her place, explaining that she has lost her son. Ms Watson's job is to convince Jeannie that she is prepared to pay a large sum to help find her son and she produces Jeff's £250 as payment. However, during the course of the conversation, Jeannie discovers that Ms Watson really would like to make contact with her dead father instead, so Jeannie decides to put her in contact with the Foster brothers.
Ms Watson calls on the Fosters and is immediately disturbed by the appearance of the house and the brothers' rather eccentric behaviour. Once they discover that Ms Watson is all alone in the world they then reveal to her their sinister plans, which are to murder her then make contact with her from 'the other side'. The motivation for doing so appears to be their many years of failure in trying to contact the dead, which they rationalise is due to the spirits not knowing that they are trying to contact them. Ms Watson of course will know, so therefore she will make contact! After a show of moving furniture, Ms Watson manages to escape the pair, discards her clothes by a lake side and swims across.
Jeannie reports back to Jeff and explains that she only got £25 from Ms Watson and that she has referred her to the Fosters. Infuriated Jeff pays the Fosters a visit, hoping to find Ms Watson and his money there. George Foster answers the door to Jeff and explains that Laura Watson was there but that she has now left. However, Marty sees Henry incinerating some items of women's clothing and also sees him hiding a car outside of the property. Marty deduces these to be Laura Watson's possessions and orders Jeff to go back and investigate.
When he returns to the property this time Henry Foster is waiting for him and orders him into the house at gunpoint. Realising that their little scheme is now out in the open the brothers call Jeannie and ask her to come over. When she arrives she is also trapped with Jeff and the pair are advised of their impending demise.
The brothers put on a particularly violent poltergeist display and Marty then sees the equipment responsible for creating the phenomenon. He causes a power surge at the local power station and the equipment explodes. Jeff and Jeannie then escape and call the police. The brothers then surrender meekly to the police.

 Halle Opera House
The Halle Opera House (German: Opernhaus Halle) is an opera house in Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. Originally named the Halle Town Theatre  (German: Stadttheater von Halle), the theatre was built in 1886. A bomb attack on 31 March 1945 destroyed much of the original building. Restorative work ensued a few years later, and the theatre reopened in 1951 under the name Landestheater Halle. In January 1992 it was renamed to its current title. The theatre is currently used for performances of opera, ballet, and orchestral concerts. It is also the main performance venue for the annual summer Handel Festival held in the city.

Catchphrase used in children's games
"Olly olly oxen free" is a catchphrase or truce term used in children's games such as hide and seek, capture the flag, and kick the can  to indicate that players who are hiding can come out into the open without losing the game; that the position of the sides in a game has changed[1] (as in which side is on the field or which side is at bat or "up" in baseball or kickball); or, alternatively, that the game is entirely over.
The origin of the phrase is unknown. The Dictionary of American Regional English says the phrase may be derived from all ye, all ye outs in free, all the outs in free, or possibly ”calling all the outs in free”; in other words, all who are out may come in without penalty.[2] Others speculate the phrase may be a corruption of a hypothetical and ungrammatical German phrase alle, alle, auch sind frei (all, all, also are free).[1]
A number of variations exist. "Ollyoxalls" is one such variant, said to be used in Portsmouth, England.[3] Another variant is "Ollie Ollie in come free."[4]
In popular culture[edit]
Various songs are named "Olly olly oxen free" or a variant thereof, including songs by the Ted Weems orchestra (sung by a young Perry Como),[5] Terry Scott Taylor (on the album Imaginarium: Songs from the Neverhood),[6] the metalcore band Sworn In,[7] and Amanda Palmer (on the album Theatre Is Evil).[8] Olly Olly Oxen Free is the name of a film starring Katharine Hepburn,[9] while Oxenfree is a 2016 videogame produced by Night School Studio.[10]
At the very end of Peter, Paul and Mary's recording of "It's Raining", they speak the more straightforward version of the phrase: "All-ee, all-ee in free."
In  Kurt Vonnegut’s 1962 novel Mother Night, the phrase’s use among children is referenced, as the narrator desires to hear an analogous message to come out of hiding.
On Victoria Williams' 1994 album Loose, the song "Polish Your Shoes" features the line "Olly olly oxen free, but be careful."[11]
In the Peanuts comic strip for October 3, 1955, Lucy hollers "Olee Olee Olsen Free-O!" Violet informs her chagrined friend that it should be "Ally ally out are in free!"[12]
The punk band Authority Zero released an album called Ollie Ollie Oxen Free in 2021.[13]
The 2017 Hollywood film XXX: Return Of Xander Cage featured the phrase, spoken by CIA operative Jane Mark Toni Collette to signal a truce after a faux tactical raid designed to re-recruit Xander.

Early life[edit]
A native of Madrid, Fernández-Cuesta studied at the local university, where he gained a law degree.[1] He was a close friend of José Antonio Primo de Rivera from childhood.[1]
An early member of the Falange, which he joined in 1933, he served as the movement's first secretary and garnered a reputation as one of the new group's most effective public speakers.[1] He was a candidate for the Falange at the 1936 election, although he was not elected.[1]
Spanish Civil War[edit]
Fernández-Cuesta was imprisoned upon the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War by Republicans and, although he escaped twice, was recaptured on both occasions.[1] He was released from captivity in October 1937 when he was involved in a prisoner swap with Justino de Azcárate, who was held by the Nationalists.[1] Soon after his release he was appointed Secretary general of the unified Falangist-Carlist movement although he did not prove talented as a political organiser and was replaced in the role by Agustín Muñoz Grandes in 1939.[1] His appointment as leader was largely intended to keep onside Falangists who feared the influence of both the Army and monarchism on Franco, but the role proved to have little power since real influence over Franco was instead to lie with Ramón Serrano Súñer.[2]
Within this early Burgos-based government of Francisco Franco, he also fulfilled the role of Agriculture Minister.[3] This too however proved to be largely a failed endeavour.[1]
Removal[edit]
Such was the influence of Súñer that, after the Spanish Civil War, he engineered the effective exile of his rival Fernández-Cuesta, who was appointed Spanish ambassador first to Brazil (1940–1942) and then to Italy (1942–1945).[4] Alongside this, Fernández-Cuesta's reputation was damaged by his failure in the Agriculture portfolio, with Spain facing famine in the 1940s largely as a consequence of the failed policies he had previously adopted in the role.[5] Nevertheless, his personal loyalty to Franco was never less than absolute, a fact that ensured he would never be fully excluded from positions of influence.[1]
Return to politics[edit]
Fernández-Cuesta was effectively absent from the frontline of Spanish politics until 1945 when he was appointed Minister of Justice.[6] As part of his remit he oversaw a liberalisation of Spain's treatment of dissidents designed to win the regime support from NATO, including announcing in December 1949 plans to release 13,000 political prisoners (although in fact only 3,000 were ultimately released under the scheme).[7] He was moved in 1951 to the post of General Secretary of the Movement and oversaw a return to much more draconian ways as unrest over rising unemployment repression under Fernández-Cuesta's direction.[8] He lost this position in early 1956 after Franco came under pressure by leading figures in the Army to remove him following a riot at the University of Madrid in which it was said that the Falangist Frente de Juventudes had acted too heavy-handedly in battling students seeking to organise their own syndicate outside of the official government body.[9] His position was however filled by his ally José Luis de Arrese as Franco continued to seek a balance between the different wings of his movement within the cabinet.[10]
Effectively sidelined, Fernández-Cuesta became loosely associated with extreme rightists such as General Iniesta Cano and Blas Piñar.[10] Removed from the political front-line once again, he nonetheless remained a member of the Cortes Españolas he became recognised as one of the most hard-line and reactionary of the old clique of Franco loyalists who continued to occupy the back benches of the parliament.[11] He was especially critical of the gradual liberalisation that began to creep in during the early 1970s as an increasingly frail Franco began to exercise less day to day power.[11]
After Franco[edit]
After Franco's death he re-founded the  Falange Española de las JONS, a nostalgic group that failed to make any headway in democratic Spain.[12] Despite leading his own party he was allowed to simultaneously hold membership of Blas Piñar's Fuerza Nueva, with the two parties running a joint campaign in the 1977 election. The groups managed only 0.21% of the vote however.[11]
Fernández-Cuesta retired from politics in February 1983, with Diego Márquez Horrillo succeeding him as Falange Española de las JONS leader.[11] He published his memoirs, Testimonio, Recuerdos y Reflexiones, in 1985.[11]

Life[edit]
Rujanović was born in the village of Krapa, in the Poreče region, part of the Ottoman Empire (now R. Macedonia). His father was Jovan Rujanović.
In 1895, he participated into the pro-Bulgarian Supreme Macedonian Committee chetas' action. Later he joined the Bulgarian-organized Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) and fought in the Kičevo region.[1] In 1899/1900 he personally sought the Serbian consuls for the establishment of a Serbian revolutionary organization and Serbian armed bands. 
In 1904, he left IMRO and joined the Serbian Chetnik Organization and established one of the first Serbian bands.[2] He participated in the battle against Stefan Dimitrov at the village of Orešje (April 1905) when the Serbian bands won the battle at Oreškim livadama against the IMRO. Also, he participated in the battle at Kurtov kamen (1907).[3][4][5] After the Young Turk Revolution (1908), he left his weapon until further Young Turk pressing, reactivating his band in 1910.[6][7]

Drag is a cover album by k.d. lang, released in 1997; most of its songs feature a smoking motif, although some address broader issues of dependence and/or addiction. The cover of Dionne Warwick's "(Theme from) Valley of the Dolls" was notably used in key scenes in the pilot episode and series finale of the Showtime comedy-drama series Nurse Jackie. Lang's cover of "Hain't It Funny" was part of the soundtrack for the 2002 film Talk to Her.[7]

Reception[edit]
In an Allmusic review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, "A collection of covers that are somehow related to smoking, Drag is far more ambitious than the average cover record... lang's rich voice and the measured arrangements make Drag a ringer for Ingénue in places, but the tone is considerably lighter and more humorous, which certainly makes it an enjoyable listen."[8]
Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn wrote "The pace is sometimes slow and demanding and a couple of the songs are marginal, but the heart of this album combines mainstream pop accessibility and torch-driven cabaret intimacy in ways that seem absolutely addicting themselves."[9]

Rock peak in Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica
Matikonis Peak (75°21′S 138°14′W﻿ / ﻿75.350°S 138.233°W﻿ / -75.350; -138.233Coordinates: 75°21′S 138°14′W﻿ / ﻿75.350°S 138.233°W﻿ / -75.350; -138.233) is a small, rather isolated rock peak that protrudes through the snow mantle of the central Coulter Heights, near the coast of Marie Byrd Land, Antarctica. It was mapped by the United States Geological Survey from surveys and U.S. Navy air photos, 1959–65, and was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names for William P. Matikonis, U.S. Navy, a damage controlman aboard USS Glacier, 1961–62.[1]

His Big White SelfDirected byNick BroomfieldStarringNick BroomfieldEugène Terre'BlancheOriginal languageEnglishProductionRunning time85 minutesReleaseOriginal networkChannel 4Original release
3 April 2006 (2006-04-03)
His Big White Self is a 2006 documentary film made by Nick Broomfield. It is a sequel to his earlier documentary The Leader, His Driver and the Driver's Wife (1991). It was first shown as part of More4's Nick Broomfield week which began on 27 February 2006. The documentary follows Broomfield as he returns to South Africa 12 years after the final end of the apartheid regime. His previous film focused largely on JP Meyer, a driver for Eugène Terre'Blanche (the leader of the far-right Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging), and JP's wife, Anita.

Content[edit]
In His Big White Self, Broomfield explores conditions after his return to Ventersdorp in the former Transvaal (now North West Province). He meets with JP, a former driver of Eugene Terre'Blanche, head of the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement), and his wife Anita to see how their lives have changed since the fall of apartheid in 1994. (He had covered the lives of the couple in his earlier documentary). JP and Anita had divorced since 1991.
JP works as an ambulance driver, splitting his time between this and his new wife. Anita moved to the town of Ottosdal and devotes much of her time to their grandchildren, teaching them Afrikaaner ways and traditions. JP expresses feelings of betrayal, as he believed that the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging would instigate a 'Boer revolution' in its quest for a white homeland after Mandela and the ANC came to power. The AWB failed to achieve this goal.
JP justifies apartheid and its principles of separation by race as the 'best way' for South Africa to exist harmoniously. Anita, by contrast, has shifted from being a radical champion of white rule to concluding that a minority has no right to govern a majority.
Eugene Terre'Blanche[edit]
Broomfield also gains access to Eugene Terre'Blanche himself, meeting him in disguise to prevent the leader from recognising him. During Broomfield's previous meeting with Terre'Blanche, the leader considered himself to have been portrayed as foolish, leading to death threats being sent to Broomfield. The film also documents some particularly noteworthy events which all occurred in the run up to the ending of Apartheid and the South African general election, 1994. This includes the events of 9 August 1991, when President F. W. de Klerk visited Ventersdorp (the leader's birthplace and a major power base for the AWB at the time), and the battle which subsequently ensued when the AWB allegedly cut the town's power supply and began firing on police.
The Storming of Kempton Park World Trade Centre is also shown. In June 1993, the AWB and other far right groups stormed the Kempton Park World Trade Centre near Johannesburg. At the time, the venue was being used for negotiations between the ANC and the National Party to end Apartheid. The AWB again made national headlines when in March 1994 they invaded the tribal homeland of Bophuthatswana, uninvited and seemingly acting as if on a hunting parade, killing many civilians. The film captures the occasion when three AWB commandos were summarily executed by a Bophuthatswanan soldier as they were attempting to leave the tribal homeland. At the time, Bophuthatswana was still a so-called independent homeland for blacks set up by the Apartheid regime and its leader, Lucas Mangope, was refusing to reintegrate the homeland with the new South Africa, prompting a coup.
The film's final scene shows Anita, still working as a nurse, treating a small black child who has sustained some minor leg wounds, which seemingly alludes to the new South Africa where black and white are no longer separate; previously, hospitals were segregated by race, as were many other public amenities.
Release[edit]
The film was released in the UK as a DVD boxset together with The Leader, His Driver and the Driver's Wife on 3 April 2006.

Category with direct sums and certain types of kernels and cokernels
In mathematics, an abelian category is a category in which morphisms and objects can be added and in which kernels and cokernels exist and have desirable properties. The motivating prototypical example of an abelian category is the category of abelian groups, Ab. The theory originated in an effort to unify several cohomology theories by Alexander Grothendieck and independently in the slightly earlier work of David Buchsbaum. Abelian categories are very stable categories; for example they are regular and they satisfy the snake lemma. The class of abelian categories is closed under several categorical constructions, for example, the category of chain complexes of an abelian category, or the category of functors from a small category to an abelian category are abelian as well. These stability properties make them inevitable in homological algebra and beyond; the theory has major applications in algebraic geometry, cohomology and pure category theory. Abelian categories are named after Niels Henrik Abel.

Definitions[edit]
A category is abelian if it is preadditive and
it has a zero object,
it has all binary biproducts,
it has all kernels and cokernels, and
all monomorphisms and epimorphisms are normal.
This definition is equivalent[1] to the following "piecemeal" definition:
A category is preadditive if it is enriched over the monoidal category Ab of abelian groups. This means that all hom-sets are abelian groups and the composition of morphisms is bilinear.
A preadditive category is additive if every finite set of objects has a biproduct. This means that we can form finite direct sums and direct products. In [2] Def. 1.2.6, it is required that an additive category have a zero object (empty biproduct).
An additive category is preabelian if every morphism has both a kernel and a cokernel.
Finally, a preabelian category is abelian if every monomorphism and every epimorphism is normal. This means that every monomorphism is a kernel of some morphism, and every epimorphism is a cokernel of some morphism.
Note that the enriched structure on hom-sets is a consequence of the first three axioms of the first definition. This highlights the foundational relevance of the category of Abelian groups in the theory and its canonical nature.
The concept of exact sequence arises naturally in this setting, and it turns out that exact functors, i.e. the functors preserving exact sequences in various senses, are the relevant functors between abelian categories. This exactness concept has been axiomatized in the theory of exact categories, forming a very special case of regular categories.
Examples[edit]
As mentioned above, the category of all abelian groups is an abelian category. The category of all finitely generated abelian groups is also an abelian category, as is the category of all finite abelian groups.
If R is a ring, then the category of all left (or right) modules over R is an abelian category. In fact, it can be shown that any small abelian category is equivalent to a full subcategory of such a category of modules (Mitchell's embedding theorem).
If R is a left-noetherian ring, then the category of finitely generated left modules over R is abelian. In particular, the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian commutative ring is abelian; in this way, abelian categories show up in commutative algebra.
As special cases of the two previous examples: the category of vector spaces over a fixed field k is abelian, as is the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over k.
If X is a topological space, then the category of all (real or complex) vector bundles on X is not usually an abelian category, as there can be monomorphisms that are not kernels.
If X is a topological space, then the category of all sheaves of abelian groups on X is an abelian category. More generally, the category of sheaves of abelian groups on a Grothendieck site is an abelian category. In this way, abelian categories show up in algebraic topology and algebraic geometry.
If C is a small category and A is an abelian category, then the category of all functors from C to A forms an abelian category. If C is small and preadditive, then the category of all additive functors from C to A also forms an abelian category. The latter is a generalization of the R-module example, since a ring can be understood as a preadditive category with a single object.
Grothendieck's axioms[edit]
In his Tōhoku article, Grothendieck listed four additional axioms (and their duals) that an abelian category A might satisfy. These axioms are still in common use to this day. They are the following:
AB3) For every indexed family (Ai) of objects of A, the coproduct *Ai exists in A (i.e. A is cocomplete).
AB4) A satisfies AB3), and the coproduct of a family of monomorphisms is a monomorphism.
AB5) A satisfies AB3), and filtered colimits of exact sequences are exact.
and their duals
AB3*) For every indexed family (Ai) of objects of A, the product PAi exists in A (i.e. A is complete).
AB4*) A satisfies AB3*), and the product of a family of epimorphisms is an epimorphism.
AB5*) A satisfies AB3*), and filtered limits of exact sequences are exact.
Axioms AB1) and AB2) were also given. They are what make an additive category abelian. Specifically:
AB1) Every morphism has a kernel and a cokernel.
AB2) For every morphism f, the canonical morphism from coim f to im f is an isomorphism.
Grothendieck also gave axioms AB6) and AB6*).

Elementary properties[edit]
Given any pair A, B of objects in an abelian category, there is a special zero morphism from A to B. This can be defined as the zero element of the hom-set Hom(A,B), since this is an abelian group.
Alternatively, it can be defined as the unique composition A → 0 → B, where 0 is the zero object of the abelian category.
In an abelian category, every morphism f can be written as the composition of an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism.
This epimorphism is called the coimage of f, while the monomorphism is called the image of f.
Subobjects and quotient objects are well-behaved in abelian categories.
For example, the poset of subobjects of any given object A is a bounded lattice.
Every abelian category A is a module over the monoidal category of finitely generated abelian groups; that is, we can form a tensor product of a finitely generated abelian group G and any object A of A.
The abelian category is also a comodule; Hom(G,A) can be interpreted as an object of A.
If A is complete, then we can remove the requirement that G be finitely generated; most generally, we can form finitary enriched limits in A.
Related concepts[edit]
Abelian categories are the most general setting for homological algebra.
All of the constructions used in that field are relevant, such as exact sequences, and especially short exact sequences, and derived functors.
Important theorems that apply in all abelian categories include the five lemma (and the short five lemma as a special case), as well as the snake lemma (and the nine lemma as a special case).
Semi-simple Abelian categories[edit]
Main article: Semi-simplicity
An abelian category 
A
{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} }
 is called semi-simple if there is a collection of objects 
{
X
i
}
i
∈ ∈ 
I
∈ ∈ 
Ob
(
A
)
{\displaystyle \{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}\in {\text{Ob}}(\mathbf {A} )}
 called simple objects (meaning the only sub-objects of any 
X
i
{\displaystyle X_{i}}
 are the zero object 
0
{\displaystyle 0}
 and itself) such that an object 
X
∈ ∈ 
Ob
(
A
)
{\displaystyle X\in {\text{Ob}}(\mathbf {A} )}
 can be decomposed as a direct sum (denoting the coproduct of the abelian category)
X
≅ ≅ 
⨁ ⨁ 
i
∈ ∈ 
I
X
i
{\displaystyle X\cong \bigoplus _{i\in I}X_{i}}
This technical condition is rather strong and excludes many natural examples of abelian categories found in nature. For example, most module categories over a ring 
R
{\displaystyle R}
 are not semi-simple; in fact, this is the case if and only if 
R
{\displaystyle R}
 is a semisimple ring.
Examples[edit]
Some Abelian categories found in nature are semi-simple, such as
Category of finite-dimensional vector spaces 
FinVect
(
k
)
{\displaystyle {\text{FinVect}}(k)}
 over a fixed field 
k
{\displaystyle k}
By Maschke's theorem the category of representations 
Rep
k
(
G
)
{\displaystyle {\text{Rep}}_{k}(G)}
 of a finite group 
G
{\displaystyle G}
 over a field 
k
{\displaystyle k}
 whose characteristic does not divide 
|
G
|
{\displaystyle |G|}
 is a semi-simple abelian category.
The category of coherent sheaves on a Noetherian scheme is semi-simple if and only if 
X
{\displaystyle X}
 is a finite disjoint union of irreducible points. This is equivalent to a finite coproduct of categories of vector spaces over different fields. Showing this is true in the forward direction is equivalent to showing all 
Ext
1
{\displaystyle {\text{Ext}}^{1}}
 groups vanish, meaning the cohomological dimension is 0. This only happens when the skyscraper sheaves 
k
x
{\displaystyle k_{x}}
 at a point 
x
∈ ∈ 
X
{\displaystyle x\in X}
 have Zariski tangent space equal to zero, which is isomorphic to 
Ext
1
(
k
x
,
k
x
)
{\displaystyle {\text{Ext}}^{1}(k_{x},k_{x})}
 using local algebra for such a scheme.[3]
Non-examples[edit]
There do exist some natural counter-examples of abelian categories which are not semi-simple, such as certain categories of representations. For example, the category of representations of the Lie group 
(
R
,
+
)
{\displaystyle (\mathbb {R} ,+)}
 has the representation
a
↦ ↦ 
[
1
a
0
1
]
{\displaystyle a\mapsto {\begin{bmatrix}1&a\\0&1\end{bmatrix}}}
which only has one subrepresentation of dimension 
1
{\displaystyle 1}
. In fact, this is true for any unipotent group[4]pg 112.
Subcategories of abelian categories[edit]
There are numerous types of (full, additive) subcategories of abelian categories that occur in nature, as well as some conflicting terminology.
Let A be an abelian category, C a full, additive subcategory, and I the inclusion functor.
C is an exact subcategory if it is itself an exact category and the inclusion I is an exact functor. This occurs if and only if C is closed under pullbacks of epimorphisms and pushouts of monomorphisms. The exact sequences in C are thus the exact sequences in A for which all objects lie in C.
C is an abelian subcategory if it is itself an abelian category and the inclusion I is an exact functor. This occurs if and only if C is closed under taking kernels and cokernels. Note that there are examples of full subcategories of an abelian category that are themselves abelian but where the inclusion functor is not exact, so they are not abelian subcategories (see below).
C is a thick subcategory if it is closed under taking direct summands and satisfies the 2-out-of-3 property on short exact sequences; that is, if 
0
→ → 
M
′
→ → 
M
→ → 
M
″
→ → 
0
{\displaystyle 0\to M'\to M\to M''\to 0}
 is a short exact sequence in A such that two of 
M
′
,
M
,
M
″
{\displaystyle M',M,M''}
 lie in C, then so does the third. In other words, C is closed under kernels of epimorphisms, cokernels of monomorphisms, and extensions. Note that P. Gabriel used the term thick subcategory to describe what we here call a Serre subcategory.
C is a topologizing subcategory if it is closed under subquotients.
C is a Serre subcategory if, for all short exact sequences 
0
→ → 
M
′
→ → 
M
→ → 
M
″
→ → 
0
{\displaystyle 0\to M'\to M\to M''\to 0}
 in A we have M in C if and only if both 
M
′
,
M
″
{\displaystyle M',M''}
 are in C. In other words, C is closed under extensions and subquotients. These subcategories are precisely the kernels of exact functors from A to another abelian category.
C is a localizing subcategory if it is a Serre subcategory such that the quotient functor 
Q
: : 
A
→ → 
A
/
C
{\displaystyle Q\colon \mathbf {A} \to \mathbf {A} /\mathbf {C} }
 admits a right adjoint.
There are two competing notions of a wide subcategory. One version is that C contains every object of A (up to isomorphism); for a full subcategory this is obviously not interesting. (This is also called a lluf subcategory.) The other version is that C is closed under extensions.
Here is an explicit example of a full, additive subcategory of an abelian category that is itself abelian but the inclusion functor is not exact. Let k be a field, 
T
n
{\displaystyle T_{n}}
 the algebra of upper-triangular 
n
× × 
n
{\displaystyle n\times n}
 matrices over k, and 
A
n
{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{n}}
 the category of finite-dimensional 
T
n
{\displaystyle T_{n}}
-modules. Then each 
A
n
{\displaystyle \mathbf {A} _{n}}
 is an abelian category and we have an inclusion functor 
I
: : 
A
2
→ → 
A
3
{\displaystyle I\colon \mathbf {A} _{2}\to \mathbf {A} _{3}}
 identifying the simple projective, simple injective and indecomposable projective-injective modules. The essential image of I is a full, additive subcategory, but I is not exact.
History[edit]
Abelian categories were introduced by Buchsbaum (1955) (under the name of "exact category")  and Grothendieck (1957) in order to unify various cohomology theories. At the time, there was a cohomology theory for sheaves, and a cohomology theory for groups. The two were defined differently, but they had similar properties. In fact, much of category theory was developed as a language to study these similarities. Grothendieck unified the two theories: they both arise as derived functors on abelian categories; the abelian category of sheaves of abelian groups on a topological space, and the abelian category of G-modules for a given group G.

Keishu Tanaka (田中 慶秋, Tanaka Keishū, 6 March 1938 – 4 January 2022) was a Japanese politician, who served in the House of Representatives in the Diet (national legislature) as a member of the Democratic Party of Japan. A native of Sōma District, Fukushima and graduate of Tokai University, he was elected for the first time in 1983. He was Minister of Justice under Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda from 1 to 23 October 2012 before resigning due to scandals over financial donations and organized crime links.

As a cabinet minister[edit]
On 1 October 2012, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda in his third cabinet lineup, appointed Tanaka as Minister of Justice to succeed Makoto Taki. He also became Minister for the Abduction Issue succeeding Jin Matsubara.[1]
Taiwanese donations[edit]
On 4 October 2012, Tanaka said that a local branch of the DPJ he heads in Kanagawa prefecture had received 420,000 yen in donations from 2006 to 2009 from a company run by Taiwanese. The money was returned on 3 October 2012, two days after he became Minister of Justice. Under the Political Funds Control Act of 1948, politicians are banned from receiving donations from foreign individuals and organizations composed mostly of foreign citizens. The possible punishments are prison terms of up to three years, or fines of up to 500,000 yen. At a 4 October 2012 press conference he said that he was not considering resigning.[2]
Yakuza connections[edit]
On 11 October 2012, the weekly magazine Shukan Shincho reported that 30 years ago Tanaka had connections to a group affiliated to the Inagawa-kai yakuza syndicate, that he had made an appearance and made a speech at a party hosted by a yakuza boss, and that he had also acted as a matchmaker for an executive member of the group.[3] He said that he would not have taken the actions if he had been aware of the yakuza connections. He denied using yakuza to pursue his own interests or to mediate their disputes.[4]
Resignation[edit]
The opposition had demanded that he explain his actions to an upper house panel on 18 October 2012. Tanaka's schedule became full and he could not appear. The following day, on 19 October 2012 he entered hospital complaining of ill health. He was checked into Tokai University Tokyo Hospital complaining of chest pains. It was widely expected that he would either tender his resignation or that he would be sacked as a minister.[5] He resigned on 23 October 2012, citing health reasons.[6] He was succeeded by Makoto Taki, who had also been his predecessor in the role.[7]
Personal life and death[edit]
Tanak died on 4 January 2022, at the age of 83.[8]

SwoopThat, LLC.TypePrivateIndustryPrice comparison service, online textbook price comparisonFounded2009HeadquartersSan Diego, California, USAKey peopleJonathan Simkin (CEO), Kevin King (CTO), Benjamin Carson (COO)
SwoopThat.com was an online textbook price comparison service. It was based in San Diego, California, it specialized in college textbooks but includes high school textbooks as well. The company's books by course search engine lets students input their class schedules, see all the required textbooks for those schedules, and find the cheapest online sources of those books.[1]  The search engine also includes a textbook exchange feature through which students can buy and sell books from other students.[2]  The website also includes a textbook buyback platform through which students can sell their textbooks back to online vendors.  SwoopThat has been featured in The New York Times, on the website of the Today Show,[3] on the website of Computerworld magazine,[4] and the weblog lifehacker.com.
History and business model[edit]
SwoopThat was founded by students from Claremont McKenna College and Harvey Mudd College. It originally existed as a product search engine with an emphasis on local products and stores.[5] It later shifted to a focus on textbooks based on a books by course model. It has since added course and textbook data from over 2,300 colleges in the United States.  Through SwoopThat, students can compare prices for new books, used books, rental books, and ebooks.[6][7][8]
Renamed to HubEdu in 2012,[9] bought by Rafter shortly after.[10]

In the 2001–02 season, Yankov played in seven matches for Slavia. He started to make his name two years later when he scored six goals in 30 league games and was called to the Bulgarian national team by then coach Hristo Stoichkov.
In summer 2005, Yankov moved to German Bundesliga side Hannover 96, initially on a loan, but made permanent in summer 2007 for a fee of around €1.30 million. In summer 2009, he was loaned to MSV Duisburg.[2]
On 8 January 2010, Yankov joined Ukrainian Premier League club Metalurh Donetsk on a two-and-a-half-year deal.[3][4] On 13 August 2010, Yankov was loaned out to Russian Premier League club FC Rostov.[5]
In July 2012, Yankov signed as a free agent for his boyhood club Slavia Sofia on a one-year contract.[6]
Yankov retired in 2014 at the age of 30, due to an injury.[7]
International career[edit]
Yankov made his debut for Bulgaria in 2004. On 13 October 2004, he scored his first goal for Bulgaria in a 4–1 win against Malta as part of the World Cup 2006 qualification campaign. On 12 October 2010, in the absence of Stilian Petrov, he captained the side for the first time in the 2–0 win against Saudi Arabia in a friendly match.

He is the author of the Speculum stultorum (A Mirror of Fools), a satire in Latin elegiac verse on the clergy and society in general.  The hero is Burnellus, or Brunellus, a foolish ass, who goes in search of a means of lengthening his tail.  Brunellus first visits Salernum to obtain drugs for this purpose. However, he loses these when attacked by a Cistercian monk with dogs. He then goes to Paris to study, but makes no progress there, being unable to remember the city's name after eight years of study. He then decides to join a religious order, but instead founds a new one by taking the easiest parts from the rules of other orders. Finally, his master recaptures him.
The poem was immensely popular for centuries. Under the title "Daun Burnel the Asse" it is mentioned by Chaucer in his Canterbury Tales, in the Nun's Priest's Tale.
Other works[edit]
Many other short Latin poems from a thirteenth-century manuscript are attributed to him, along with a prose treatise, Contra Curiales et Officinales Clericos.  This treatise is an affectionate reproof to William Longchamp the Chancellor, in his role as Bishop of Ely. Wireker takes his intimate friend (possibly a relative) to task for attempting to combine Church with State.

English rower and barrister
Robert Alexander Kinglake (9 June 1843 – 10 June 1915) was an English rower and barrister.
Kinglake was born at Taunton. He was the second son of John Alexander Kinglake, MP for Rochester, and his wife Louisa Rebecca Liddon, daughter of John Liddon of Taunton. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge.[1]  Kinglake rowed in the Cambridge boat in the Boat Races of 1863, 1864, 1865 and 1866, all of which were won by Oxford. He was president of Cambridge University Boat Club in 1866.[2]  In 1864 he won the Silver Goblets at Henley Royal Regatta partnering John Richardson Selwyn.[3]
Kinglake was admitted at the Inner Temple in November 1865 and was called to the bar on 17 November 1868. He was on the Western Circuit, and was Recorder of Penzance from 1883 to 1899 and of Bournemouth from 1899 to 1915.
Kinglake later lived at Moushill Manor, Milford, Surrey. He died at Harrogate at the age of 72.

Plot[edit]
Bagavathi owns a tea shop, while Vadivelu, works at his tea shop. Bagavathi lives with his younger brother Guna. He meets a girl named Anjali. She ends up appreciating his kindness, and they fall in love. Guna has a girlfriend named Priya, with whom he secretly develops a physical relationship. Guna's love is objected to by Priya's father, Easwarapandiyan. Bagavathi tries to convince Easwarapandiyan to let Priya and Guna marry, but is humiliated. Guna attempts to marry Priya with his brother's help, but Easwarapandiyan kills Guna, as well as Bagavathi's friend Anand, who is trying to defend Guna.
Bagavathi mourns over Guna's death. Guna, in his last moments, promises he will be with his brother forever. After Guna's death, everyone realises that Priya is pregnant. Bagavathi thinks that Guna will be reborn again. However, Easwarapandiyan attempts to kill the child before birth. Bagavathi challenges him, saying the child will touch the earth. In order to do so, Ganga helps him turn into a gangster. With the help of Anjali and Vadivelu, Bagavathi overcomes all hurdles by Easwarapandiyan and manages to protect Priya to allow for the safe birth of his brother's child. In the end, Bagavathi avenges the death of his brother by killing Easwarapandian.

Production[edit]
The director A. Venkatesh selected a newcomer, Jai, to play the role of Guna after seeing him at Jai's uncle, Deva's, recording studio — mentioning that the youngster looked like actor Vijay. Although his role in the film was relatively minimal, he has since gone on to appear in successful films such as Chennai 600028, Subramaniyapuram and Engeyum Eppodhum.[4]

"The Thrill"(2020)
"The Thrill"  is a song by American rapper Wiz Khalifa and Australian electronic music duo Empire of the Sun. The song uses a prominent sample of Empire of the Sun's 2008 single "Walking on a Dream". In 2009, Wiz Khalifa recorded "The Thrill" for his 2009 mixtape Burn After Rolling, using the then illegal sample.[1][2] The song was officially released on November 12, 2020.[3][4]
Wiz Khalifa said of the release "'The Thrill' is a really special song to me because I seen [sic.] that one grow from the ground up. I remember being at a low key show at a college and one of the kids told me about the song and he said 'man you'll be that dude if you sample the song' So I immediately went home, started thinking of some bars, went to the studio and recorded it and it was one of those songs that we took on the road and made our own videos for, and performed it, and the world loved it  and I'm happy that it's available on all streaming platforms and that people can enjoy it the way that they need to now."[1]
Empire of the Sun said "As this track was breaking for us around the globe we kept hearing undercurrents of Wiz's version. 'Walking on a Dream' is a song that morphs and transcends so many emotions and musical plains that it's great to hear it alive in another world, Wiz's world."[1]
Reception[edit]
Hot New Hip Hop said "Khalifa's 'The Thrill' takes a cut from indie electro act Empire of the Sun and turns it into an effective party rap jam".[1]
XXL Magazine called it "One of Wiz Khalifa's 20 Best Songs."[1][5]
Peter Sobat from Blurred Culture said "In these strange times Wiz Khalifa's 'The Thrill' takes us back to less stressful points in our lives and reminds us to lighten up and have some fun."[6]

Veridagon avendanoiDíaz Cruz et al. 2019[1]
Veridagon avendanoi is an extinct aulopiform ray-finned fish related to species of Enchodus from the Cenomanian-aged Cintalapa Formation, exposed in El Chango Quarry, Chiapas, Mexico. Its original generic name was Dagon; however, this name was preoccupied by a group of South American butterflies. The generic name was eventually amended to Veridagon.[2]
Etymology[edit]
The original generic name refers to both Dagon, the fish god of the Philistines, and the Lovecraft character.  The amended generic name has the added suffix "veri," derived from the Latin, verus, meaning "true" or "real."[2]
Appearance[edit]
The holotype and only specimen is 220 millimetres (8.7 in) long. It depicts a fusiform animal similar in anatomy to Enchodus, with a series of small dorsally placed plates on the roof of its head.

Yamanaka Castle (山中城, Yamanaka-jō) was a Sengoku period yamajiro-style Japanese castle, built by the Odawara Hōjō clan in Tagata District, Izu Province, in what is now eastern Mishima, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan. The ruins have been protected by the central government as a National Historic Site since 1988.[1]

Overview[edit]
Yamanaka Castle overlooks the strategic Tōkaidō highway halfway of western slope of Hakone Pass. The Tōkaidō highway was the main route between Kyoto and the Kantō region of Japan. The castle has a long and narrow structure, consisting of two lines of connected enclosures extending west and south of the second bailey, which is located just below the inner bailey. These enclosures are protected by deep, wet and dry moats, which were divided into small compartments to further complicate the movement of attackers.
History[edit]
The late Hōjō clan was based at Odawara Castle in far western Sagami Province and only a few kilometers from the border with Suruga Province ruled by the Imagawa clan. The Hōjō and Imagawa maintained an alliance; however, after the fall of the Imagawa clan, Suruga was occupied by the Takeda clan of Kai Province and the Hōjō territories were threatened. This threat did not diminish after the Takeda clan was destroyed by an alliance between Oda Nobunaga and Tokugawa Ieyasu, both of whom were at odds against the Hōjō.  Yamanaka Castle was built by Hōjō Ujiyasu in the Eiroku era (1558–1577) to guard against this threat.
Despite the growing tension between the Hōjō and Toyotomi Hideyoshi, only a modest attempt was made to strength the defenses of the castle in 1586. When the Toyotomi armies attacked Odawara in 1590, Hideyoshi ordered Toyotomi Hidetsugu and Tokugawa Ieyasu to reduce Yamanaka Castle as quickly as possible, as it lie directly in his line of communications between the front lines and Osaka. In March, the two commanders attacked Yamanaka castle with 50,000 soldiers. In response, Hōjō Ujikatsu resisted with only 4,000 troops. Despite the disparity in numbers, the Toyotomi forces took heavy losses, including one general, Hitotsuyanagi Naosue; however, the castle fell in only a half day of combat and most of its defenders were killed.
Yamanaka Castle was not rebuilt during the Edo period, and the site reverted to forest. All that remains are fragmentary portions of its moats and earthworks.
In 2006, the site of Yamanaka Castle was listed as one of the 100 Fine Castles of Japan by the Japan Castle Foundation, primarily due to its historical significance.

Calendar and results[edit]
The initial calendar was released on 29 September 2019 with 7 rounds scheduled across Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and Czech Republic.[16] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic on 16 March 2020 the pre-season test and the opening round, both scheduled to be held at the Motorsport Arena Oschersleben, were cancelled.[17][18] The first revision of the calendar saw Autodrom Most in August as the season opener.[19] On 24 May 2020 the final version of the calendar was published with the round at the Autodrom Most replaced by a round at the Lausitzring.[20][21]

Life and career[edit]
1987–2011: Early life and Owl City[edit]
Breanne Düren was born on October 9, 1987, to Jill and Louis Dürenberger. She has two sisters, Thuressa Dürenberger and Celesta Bork, and a brother, Caleb Dürenberger. She also has two nieces, Olivia and Isabella.
As a child, Düren's parents put her in vocal lessons because she was always singing. She also took piano and dance lessons.[citation needed] She attended Apple Valley High School.[2]
During college, a friend suggested that she would be perfect to work with Adam Young of Owl City.[3] She is featured in a duet in the songs "The Saltwater Room" (on both Maybe I'm Dreaming and Ocean Eyes), "The Tip Of the Iceberg",[4] and "Honey And The Bee" and sings background vocals in "On The Wing" and "Air Traffic". She also plays the keyboard and provides backing vocals for Owl City on his tours. While touring with Owl City in 2012, Düren filled-in for Carly Rae Jepsen on the live version of "Good Time." She also provides backing vocals in "Silhouettes", a song by Swimming with Dolphins of which Young was previously a member.[5]
Breanne sings background vocals in Jamestown Story's version of "Take Me Home Tonight" by Eddie Money. She also sings background vocals in their song "Summer" from their album "Love vs. Life".
2011–Present: Sparks and Gem[edit]
Düren wrote the songs on her EP "Sparks" while on tour.[6] It was released by her own record label, dürendüren records, on May 3, 2011. Songs included her first single "Gold Mine", "No One Else", and "Daydreams".[7] Rick Florino of artistdirect gave the EP "5/5 stars".[8]
Released in April 2011, the "Gold Mine" music video features dancing and choreography by Düren and the Apple Valley AVaires. It was directed by Brandon Boulay.[9] Düren has often stated that the song was about how she was "at a place in her life where she had many questions" and was "finding out a lot about herself".[10]
The music video for "No One Else" was released June 23, 2011, and was also directed by Brandon Boulay.[11] Düren has stated that the song was about being on the road but missing her loved ones at home.[12]
In 2010, Breanne was featured on the song "Lament" by Robbie Seay Band (on their album Miracle).[13]
Breanne lent her vocals to Ari Herstand's 2008 record, Whispering Endearments.[14]
On March 5, 2010, Breanne released a cover song titled "Everlasting Light", originally performed by The Black Keys, via her Twitter account.[15][16]
On April 3, 2012, Breanne sang a duet with Minnesota-based singer/songwriter Dustin Hatzenbuhler on the song "The Fight". (on his debut album Fall).[17]
On March 2, 2014, Porter Robinson released the lead single from his album Worlds, titled "Sea of Voices". It features uncredited vocals by Breanne.[18] She also has featured vocals on the song "Years of War", from Worlds.
On July 18, 2014, Breanne revealed that she would be making a new EP via her Twitter, using Indiegogo as a fundraising tool.[19]
On September 18, 2015, Breanne released Gem - EP on iTunes.

Music video"10 Minutes" on YouTube
"10 Minutes" is the debut single by South Korean singer Lee Hyori from her debut studio album Stylish...E, which was released through DSP Media and CJ E&M on August 13, 2003. A hip hop and dance number, "10 Minutes" was written by MayBee with production handled by Kim Do-hyun. Following its release, the song became a commercial hit in South Korea and spurred numerous musical and fashion trends at the time—its popularity gave way to what domestic media dubbed as the "Hyori Syndrome".[1]
The accompanying music video for "10 Minutes" was directed by Seo Hyun-seung; it was initially banned from broadcast by SBS, which judged its choreography to be too erotic. Lee promoted the song with live performances on various South Korean music programs throughout August and September, including Music Camp and Inkigayo. The song received multiple accolades at year-end award shows, including Most Popular Music Video at the 2003 Mnet Music Video Festival and the Grand Prize at the annual KBS Music Awards.

Background[edit]
"10 Minutes" – Lee Hyori
A sample of "10 Minutes", a hip hop and dance track that lyrically revolves around the theme of seductiveness.
Problems playing this file? See media help.
Well known in South Korea as a member of girl group Fin.K.L managed under DSP Media, the group released their last studio album Eternity in March 2002; the record peaked at number two on the MIAK monthly albums chart and sold over 250,000 copies.[2] Beginning in 2003, the members began exploring individual activities, thus putting group activities in a temporary hiatus.[3] Lee Hyori embarked on a solo career with the release of her debut studio album Stylish...E, which spawned the lead single "10 Minutes".[4]
Written by musician and lyricist MayBee with production handled by Kim Do-hyun, the track is primarily a hip hop and dance number that lyrically conveys how Lee can seduce a man in ten minutes.[5][6]
Promotion[edit]
Music video[edit]
The accompanying music video was directed by Seo Hyun-seung, who would later become a major director for artists under YG Entertainment. Upon the release of the video, however, television network SBS banned it from public broadcast due to dance moves resembling that of sex, which SBS judged inappropriate for television.[7] A re-edited version of the video with the scenes removed was soon sent to the network and was made available for broadcast.[8] Nevertheless, the video was well received—in an internet survey ranking the 100 best Korean music videos conducted by MTV Korea in July 2004, "10 Minutes" ranked at number three.[9]
Live performances[edit]
To promote "10 Minutes" and Stylish...E, Lee made appearances at various live concerts and weekly music programs following its release. On August 16, Lee made her first performance as a solo artist since Fin.K.L at the 2003 Star Ting Concert, where she performed "10 Minutes" and "One Two Three N'Four", despite a recording mishap.[10] The following day, she made her live television debut with both songs on the music program Inkigayo;[11] she continued to promote the song on different music programs throughout August and September. On November 27, she performed the song live at the 2003 Mnet Music Video Festival, where she was the most nominated act of the night. At the 2008 Mnet Km Music Festival, Lee and boy group Big Bang performed together a medley of their songs, which included parts of "10 Minutes".[12]
Awards[edit]
 The song's popularity led to what South Korean media called the "Hyori Syndrome".[1]
"10 Minutes" won numerous accolades, including the Most Popular Music Video daesang at the 2003 Mnet Music Video Festival[13] and the Grand Prize at the annual KBS Music Awards.[14] It additionally received two bonsang prizes at the latter ceremony and the 18th Golden Disc Awards.[15]

Cultural impact[edit]
Lee's solo debut with "10 Minutes" has been noted by publications as the mark of her transition to a primarily sexual image.[17][18] The Korea Herald noted how the track led to a wave of interest that came to be known as "Hyori Syndrome", leading her to be dubbed the "sexy queen of K-pop."[19] Writing about the effect of the "Hyori Syndrome" in the industry, an editor from Beautytap said that "the flirty images of K-pop girl groups today can be credited in large part to Hyori pushing the limits"; "Hyori rocked racy outfits, danced provocatively in her videos, and didn’t seem afraid to push the limits of what was considered 'acceptable sex appeal' at the time in Korea."[20] A reporter from domestic media outlet Star News wrote that since "10 Minutes" in 2003, Lee created a boom in the industry among women of all ages, and became a trendsetter in the South Korean fashion world.[21]
Having appeared on the front page of newspapers 891 times after the release of "10 Minutes", Lee set a Guinness World Record at the time for the highest number of front-page newspaper appearances.[22] In 2007, The Korea Times named Lee one of 10 Influential Women on the Cultural Scene since 1950, saying that "the Lee Hyori syndrome spread around the country" after the release of "10 Minutes", leading to her becoming a fashion icon and the highest-paid female singer in Korea at that point.[23] Marie Claire included the song in their list of 35 essential K-pop songs, writing that "it was so popular that 2003 was nicknamed 'The Year of Hyori' in Korean media."[24] In a panel of 35 music critics organized by Seoul Shinmun and Melon, "10 Minutes" was ranked the 16th greatest K-pop song of all-time; music critic Subtle said that the song yielded major influence on female idols, which still showed years after its initial release.[25]

The Simple Common Gateway Interface (SCGI) is a protocol for applications to interface with HTTP servers, as an alternative to the CGI protocol. It is similar to FastCGI but is designed to be easier to parse. Unlike CGI, it permits a long-running service process to continue serving requests, thus avoiding delays in responding to requests due to setup overhead (such as connecting to a database).
SCGI is a protocol which defines communication between a web server and an application server. This is in contrast to CGI, which is an earlier application (gateway) interface designed to let the application programmer avoid the complexity of sockets and long-running service processes when poor scalability and high overhead are acceptable.
The SCGI protocol leverages the fact that the web server has already parsed and validated the HTTP request, and canonically communicates the request to the SCGI server while letting the application programmer avoid parsing ambiguities and protocol edge cases. This avoids the complicated header-parsing and header-combining rules from RFC 2616, saving significant complexity in the SCGI server process.

History[edit]
Neil Schemenauer published the original SCGI protocol specification dated October 2001.[1] He developed the first implementations of SCGI and initially published them in April 2002.[2]
Specification[edit]
The client connects to a SCGI server over a reliable stream protocol allowing transmission of 8-bit bytes. The client begins by sending a request. When the SCGI server sees the end of the request it sends back a response and closes the connection. The format of the response is not specifically specified by this protocol, although CGI-equivalent HTTP responses are generally used.[note 1]
Request format[edit]
A SCGI request is the concatenation of netstring-encoded headers and a body. A SCGI response is a normal HTTP response.
Each header consists of a name–value pair, where both the name and the value are null-terminated strings (C strings). The value can be an empty string, in which case the terminating null still remains. Neither name nor value can contain any embedded null bytes. These considerations are standard for C strings, but are often confusing for programmers used to other standards for string-handling.
All provided headers are concatenated to form a single byte sequence, then netstring-encoded. The raw body, if any, is then appended.
Duplicate names are not allowed in the request headers; RFC 2616-compliant header combining[note 2] must already have taken place. The first request header must have the name "CONTENT_LENGTH" and a value that is the length of the body in decimal. The "CONTENT_LENGTH" request header must always be present, even if its value is "0". There must also always be a request header with the name "SCGI" and a value of "1". Standard CGI environment variables should be provided in SCGI headers for compatibility when converting older CGI programs to SCGI. The body (if any) provided in the request follows the headers; its length is specified by the "CONTENT_LENGTH" request header.
While the SCGI protocol insulates the service programmer from some HTTP considerations, various details (such as interpreting the octets of the message body as per the Transfer-Encoding header, the CONTENT_LENGTH being the number of octets after the body has been encoded for transmission, etc.) still require knowledge of the HTTP protocol specification.
Example[edit]
The web server (a SCGI client) opens a connection and sends the concatenation of the following strings to the service process (a SCGI server):
       "70:"
           "CONTENT_LENGTH" <00> "27" <00>
           "SCGI" <00> "1" <00>
           "REQUEST_METHOD" <00> "POST" <00>
           "REQUEST_URI" <00> "/deepthought" <00>
       ","
       "What is the answer to life?"
The SCGI server sends the following response back to the web server:
       "Status: 200 OK" <0d 0a>
       "Content-Type: text/plain" <0d 0a>
       "" <0d 0a>
       "42"
The SCGI server closes the connection.
