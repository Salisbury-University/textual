					<p>For users wishing to perform their own expirimentation using our dataset the following tutorial will explain the basic process of downloading a sample subset of our data. This example will show the process for the ABC News collection of data, however, the same steps can be followed for any other set of data. This dataset provides a good representation of the type of data we have collected, showing the change in the English language overtime.
					<br/><br/>
					The ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) News contains over 1,000,000 news article headlines published over the course of 19 years. The dataset summarises a historical record of the most significant events that took place globally from the early 2000s to the early 2020s. While this dataset contains global events, however, the primary focus is on events that took place in Australia. The data was obtained by taking a sample of two hundred articles per day. These articles contain a good amount of international events, looking at the headlines, the most significant events can be singled out, showing how history has been shaped over the past two decades. Some examples of these events include elections, financial crises, or ecological disasters.
