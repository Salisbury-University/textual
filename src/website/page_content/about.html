			<!-- ABOUT PARAGRAPH -->
			<p class="about_intro">
				Traditionally, collections of English language data have been inaccessible, limited to a specific time period, or expensive. This project is attempting to remedy all of these issues at once with the creation of an Open Source English Textual Baseline. The data available has been gathered from a variety of open source websites and collections. The dataset may be freely downloaded on browsed from this site.
			</p>

			<p class="about_intro" id="second_paragraph">
				Currently the dataset contains ~320 million unique entries and is continuing to grow. Using this collection of data as a baseline will allow for inference on questions pertaining to how humans use and have used the English Language. Some examples of possible avenues of research can be explored in our tutorials section.
