				<div id="review_analysis_text">
					<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_1" class="review_analysis_paragraph">The Yelp review site provides access to a large collection of reviews across a large variety of categories. In addition to containing the review text, the Yelp review dataset has the number of stars specified in each review. These review rating can be used for aditional analysis, such as training a neural network predict the number of stars a review should have based on its wording.</p>

					<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_2" class="review_analysis_paragraph">The current collection of Yelp reviews in the database contains roughly ~7.5 million reviews, each entry containing the review text, the date posted, the review rating, and additional information. Many kinds of analysis can be done with this data but for the purposes of this application only the reivew's text and rating were used.</p>

					<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_3" class="review_analysis_paragraph">This project looked into predicting a review's rating based on the way its text was worded. With negative sounding reviews primarily being on the lower half of the 5-star scale and the more positive reviews residing on the other. For the purposes of the training the neural network approximately 1.5 million reviews were extracted from the database and formated as comma separated values (.csv).</p>

					<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_4" class="review_analysis_paragraph">The neural network was trained using Google's Cloud Computing Service, Google Colab. After being trained on the reviews the network achieved a training classifaction accuracy of ~85% and a validation accuracy of ~70%. There is still room for improvement with the network's performance, however, for the time being these values are acceptable. An explanation of the network and the source code are available below.</p>

				<div id="review_analysis_text_2">
				<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_5" class="review_analysis_paragraph">The primary backbone of the classifier is a Bidirection Long Short Term Memory Network or an LSTM. A Bidirectional LSTM is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) meaing that the network learns using feedback loops. These loops allow the network to share information it learns with other layers, allowing it to have a "memory."</p>

				<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_5" class="review_analysis_paragraph">One problem with tradtional RNNs that the LSTM helps solve is the issue of long-term dependency. The LSTM solves this by using a special network to pass the information learned forward through the network, additionally the network is able to add or remove information it has learned as needed.</p>
		
				<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_6" class="review_analysis_paragraph">The Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory Network futher improves upon the LSTM by allowing inforation within the network to flow both forward and backward. For example if we have a sentence we cannot currently predict such as "I am _____" but later the network sees the sentence "I'm always happy" the LSTM is able to now predict the previously unpredictable blank space by passing information back through the network.</p>

							<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_7" class="review_analysis_paragraph">The Yelp review dataset is a collection of reviews supplied through an official data dump by the Yelp review site. As stated previously, these reviews span a large variety of categories and businesses. As of the time of this project, the Yelp data dump supplied around seven and a half million unique reviews. These reviews contain the text associated with the review and also provides additional metadata such as the data of publishing and the number of stars the reviewer gave to the reviewed establishment.</p>
							<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_8" class="review_analysis_paragraph">To collect the provided data a Python script was written to load in the Yelp reviews data dump (in JSON format) and save each review into the MongoDB database. Processing the data involves opening the JSON file and reading in each rview, the review is saved into a Python list containing all the review content, metadata, and associated tags. The Python list is then pushed into the database using the Python MongoDB library. As of the writing of this documentation the Python script has been run, storing all 7.5 million reviews into the Textual Baseline Database.</p>
							<p id="review_analysis_paragraph_9" class="review_analysis_paragraph">To train the network a small subset of this data was extracted from the database. Using the MongoDB shell 1,000,000 of the reviews were downloaded with their review text and the number of stars associated with it. The data was split in a 80:20 fashion, 200,000 reviews were used for validation and the remaining 800,000 reviews were used to train the network.</p>
