Her great-grandfather was a sheep rancher near Chino, California, and her grandfather and father both lived in the Pomona Valley in Southern California. Her mother's family, however, is largely based in Rhode Island. Hartig was raised in Rancho Cucamonga in San Bernardino County, California,[2] where she attended and graduated from the local public school system.[1]Hartig received a bachelor's degree in history from the University of California, Los Angeles, and spent part of her undergraduate career studying at the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia.[2] She received her master's degree in public history from the University of California, Riverside in 1989 and her Ph.D. in American architectural history and material culture studies from UC-Riverside in 2001.[2]Hartig worked as a municipal preservation planner for more than 10 years,[3] serving for a time as Senior Planner with the city of Riverside, California.[4] She also founded her own preservation consulting firm.[3]Dr. Hartig was an assistant professor of history at La Sierra University from 2000 to 2005, teaching history and cultural studies. She also taught graduate courses in historic preservation at UC-Riverside.[3] From 2001 to 2005, she also served as chair of the California State Historic Resources Commission.[5]Preservation career[edit]In 2005, Hartig was appointed director of the Western Office of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.

During Hartig's tenure, she raised $20 million in a capital fundraising campaign, launched the organization's first digital library, and significantly raised attendance at CHS museum exhibits from a few thousand to more than 100,000. She won funding from the state of California, which had not contributed to the organization before, and quadrupled the CHS annual operating budget to $5.2 million.[1]National Museum of American History[edit]On December 12, 2018, the Smithsonian Institution announced it had appointed Hartig as the director of the National Museum of American History, succeeding six-year incumbent John Gray.[6] She is the first woman to hold this position at the museum.[1][6]Other roles and honors[edit]Hartig has served on the board of directors of a wide range of local, state, and national history and historic preservation organizations, including the California Council for the Promotion of History and the California Preservation Foundation.[3] As of 2018, she also served as a cultural resources specialist for the California State Park and Recreation Commission.[6]Dr. Hartig has authored several books and a number of articles in academic and professional journals.[3]Hartig received the 2011 California Preservationist of the Year Award from the California Preservation Foundation in recognition of her contribution to the cause of historic preservation in California.[3]Personal life[edit]Hartig is married to John A. Swiecki, principal planner for the city of Brisbane, California.[2] The couple has two college-age sons.[1]References[edit]^ a b c d e Whiting, Sam (December 13, 2018).

Some 7,000 Polish Jews were imprisoned there from all neighbouring settlements for the purpose of persecution and exploitation.[1][2] Two years later, beginning 21 August 1942 during the most deadly phase of the Holocaust in occupied Poland, they were rounded up – men, women and children – and deported to Treblinka extermination camp aboard Holocaust trains.[3] In the process of Ghetto liquidation, some 1,300 Jews were summarily executed by the SS in the streets of Mińsk Mazowiecki.[2]Contents1 History1.1 Ghetto resistance2 Notable individuals3 See also4 References5 External linksHistory[edit]Further information: Jewish ghettos in German-occupied PolandFollowing the September 1939 Nazi-Soviet invasion of Poland, on 25 October 1940 a ghetto was created in Mińsk 41 kilometres (25 mi) east of Warsaw,[4] around the heavily shelled town square,[1] and along the streets of Siennicka, Nadrzeczna, Mostowa and Warszawska. Some 5,000 Jews were forced to relocate there from all over the city,[3] which was followed by the ghetto expansion with more dispossessed Jews brought in from Kałuszyn, Kalisz, Lipno, and Pabianice.[2] Those confined within the boundaries of the ghetto were allowed starvation rations by the SS for unreasonable amounts of money.[1] Whenever possible, they received help from the non-Jewish Poles on the outside who smuggled food, and passed around kennkartes forged by the underground.[5] Such activity presented a grave danger due to the presence of the German minority in Mińsk serving with the local Sonderdienst battalion (the gun-wielding Sonderdienst were formed by Gauleiter Frank on 6 May 1940).[6] Among the Polish Righteous were Helena and Julian Grobelny, President of Żegota, who harbored over a dozen Jewish activists in their home nearby.[7] There were also Christian Poles executed by the SS under the charge of aiding Jews.[5]Ghetto resistance[edit] Memorial to the Holocaust victims at the Jewish cemetery in MińskThe underground resistance formed in the ghetto in mid 1941 and began planning an escape to freedom. Donations were collected for the purpose of buying weapons. A Jewish fund-raising was organized in June and July 1942.[4] However, the very next month a ghetto liquidation action began on 21 August,[1] commanded by SS-Untersturmführer Schmidt, the chief of Mińsk Gestapo.[6] Some 5,000 Jews were loaded onto freight trains, locked in and sent away to Treblinka on the following day. Most of the remaining 1,000 to 1,300 Jews (many attempting to hide)[1] were shot at various locations around town,[2] along with all members of the Judenrat including its president Mosze Kramarz, his deputy Majer Bryks, as well as Jankiel Popowski, Hil Morgensztern, Mosze Wajnberg, Mr. Bressler, Mr. Słoń,  Mr. Sztutman and others murdered behind the SS building on 35 Warszawska street.[5] Several hundred men were allowed to live and split into prisoner work battalions, temporarily. The first group composed of 150 men was placed at the prewar iron foundry K. Rudzki i S-ka taken over by the Nazis, which was located at 55 Piłsudskiego street. The second group of around 500 men was moved to the premises of the Public School Nr 1 at 39 Siennicka street,[5] as the work force for German company Wolf & Goebel.[1] German announcement in Mińsk, prohibiting Jews from venturing outside the Ghetto specified area. Signed by Kreishauptmann Bittrich on 12 December 1941.The final wave of mass shootings began several months later. A large group of Jews from the school building (renamed Camp Kopernikus) were transported to the Jewish cemetery on 24 December 1942 and murdered there; those who remained (around 250 slave workers) were killed on 10 January 1943 following the Kopernikus prisoner revolt.[1][5] The SS surrounded the premises planning a deportation action, but the prisoners locked themselves inside and resisted, putting the SS in a state of shocked disbelief. After a struggle, the building was eventually set on fire and burned down with the Jews inside.[1] Meanwhile, at the K. Rudzki foundry (renamed Krupp AG) over 100 Jewish workers were extracted on 5 June 1943, and executed as the last.[5] The Ghetto was no more.[5] An underground resistance movement developed in Mińsk,[8] and later the Polish Home Army (AK) got a chance to retaliate. On 22 July 1943 the Gestapo chief Schmidt was ambushed and shot by the partisans.[9]At the end of the German occupation of Poland, Mińsk Mazowiecki was liberated not by the advancing Red Army, but by the Polish soldiers of the AK who entered the town ahead of them.[9] Although 250 Jews of Mińsk are known to have survived – many of them saved by the Polish families on the "Aryan" side of the city (including those who managed to escape Treblinka deportations), the prewar Jewish community was effectively wiped out in Mińsk during the Holocaust. There was no-one, and nothing to go back to, after the war ended.[1] The community, which had thrived since 1768, ceased to exist entirely.  It has not been re-established.[5]Notable individuals[edit]Julian Grobelny, Polish Righteous among the Nations who presided over Żegota, and sheltered Jews in hiding near Mińsk.See also[edit]Pińsk Ghetto revoltŁachwa Ghetto revoltReferences[edit]^ a b c d e f g h i j Alicja Gontarek, historian of the „Biuletyn Gminy Wyznaniowej Żydowskiej w Warszawie” (2014).

They were later found to be widely distributed in mammalian neural and endocrine cells.The amphibian peptides which belong to this family are currently classified into three subfamilies;[1][2] the Bombesin group, which includes bombesin and alytesin; the Ranatensin group, which includes ranatensins, litorin, and Rohdei litorin; and the Phyllolitorin group, which includes Leu(8)- and Phe(8)-phyllolitorins.In mammals and birds two categories of bombesin-like peptides are known,[3][4] gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), which stimulates the release of gastrin as well as other gastrointestinal hormones, and neuromedin B (NMB), a neuropeptide whose function is not yet clear. Bombesin-like peptides, like many other active peptides, are synthesized as larger protein precursors that are enzymatically converted to their mature forms. The final peptides are eight to fourteen residues long.References[edit]^ Erspamer V, Erspamer GF, Mazzanti G, Endean R (1984).

It is owned by the Jiangsu Committee of the CCP.[1]Contents1 History1.1 Political positions2 Coverage3 External links4 ReferencesHistory[edit]The Xinhua Daily was founded in Hankou on 11 January, 1938.[2] After the fall of Wuhan in October 1938, the paper continued to publish in Chongqing.[3] The Xinhua Daily was the only newspaper published by the CCP during the Second Sino-Japanese War, and was published by the party in order to consolidate public sentiment against the Japanese. As a propaganda instrument, the paper faced competition from the Jiefang Daily, which began publishing on 16 May 1941 under the direct control of Mao Zedong. The Jiefang Daily was created as part of Mao's larger strategy to move the CCP's propaganda arm under his direct control - the Xinhua Daily had moved to Chongqing and was not controlled by Mao.[4] The Chongqing edition of the Xinhua Daily was controlled directly by Zhou Enlai until February 1947.[5]Political positions[edit]In the relatively liberal media environment of war-time Chongqing, the Xinhua Daily competed with other publications of different affiliations, as the Kuomintang was not able to exert ironclad control over speech. However hardline supporters of the Kuomintang made serious attempts to stifle the Xinhua Daily as a newspaper of the CCP, such as refusing to grant it legal rights for paper distribution, exerting control over post offices and newspaper vendors, and by implementing a newspaper censorship system that inspected all content published by the paper.[3]Other newspapers publishing in Chongqing included the Ta Kung Pao (then an independent newspaper also known as L'Impartial) and a Kuomintang newspaper, the Zhongyang Ribao (Central Daily News), along with many other smaller papers.[6] Along with L'Impartial, the Xinhua Daily published vernacular poetry, compared to the strictly classical poetry published by Central Daily News. Written vernacular Chinese (Chinese: 白話; pinyin: baihua) had been associated with the progressive movement since the New Culture Movement in 1917, whereas the classical language was associated with conservatism. Xinhua Daily published a number of poems by the poet Liu Yazi, many of which commented on the arrival of Mao in Chongqing in 1945 for peace talks with Chiang Kai-shek. Mao was then believed to be a proponent of multiparty democracy that Xinhua Daily championed regularly. On February 28, 1947, the publication of the Xinhua Daily was forbidden by the Kuomintang. Later, on April 23, 1949, Xinhua Daily began publication with official support.[citation needed]Coverage[edit]The Xinhua Daily was formed during the latter part of the Nanjing Massacre and began publishing news reports of the Japanese Army's atrocities after January 1938, particularly after Western reporting on the topic dwindled in February 1938.[7]External links[edit]Official websiteReferences[edit]^ Kuang, Xianwen; Wang, Hui (June 2020).

A case has been made for artistic continuity in Europe from the Bronze Age, and indeed the preceding Neolithic age; however archaeologists generally use "Celtic" to refer to the culture of the European Iron Age from around 1000 BC onwards, until the conquest by the Roman Empire of most of the territory concerned, and art historians typically begin to talk about "Celtic art" only from the La Tène period (broadly 5th to 1st centuries BC) onwards.[1] Early Celtic art is another term used for this period, stretching in Britain to about 150 AD.[2]  The Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, which produced the Book of Kells and other masterpieces, and is what "Celtic art" evokes for much of the general public in the English-speaking world, is called Insular art in art history.  This is the best-known part, but not the whole of, the Celtic art of the Early Middle Ages, which also includes the Pictish art of Scotland.[3]Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence.[4]  Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic.  Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare.  Possibly the few standing male figures found, like the Warrior of Hirschlanden and the so-called "Lord of Glauberg", were originally common in wood.Also covered by the term is the visual art of the Celtic Revival (on the whole more notable for literature) from the 18th century to the modern era, which began as a conscious effort by Modern Celts, mostly in the British Isles, to express self-identification and nationalism, and became popular well beyond the Celtic nations, and whose style is still current in various popular forms, from Celtic cross funerary monuments to interlace tattoos.  Coinciding with the beginnings of a coherent archaeological understanding of the earlier periods, the style self-consciously used motifs closely copied from works of the earlier periods, more often the Insular than the Iron Age.  Another influence was that of late La Tène "vegetal" art on the Art Nouveau movement.Typically, Celtic art is ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature central to the classical tradition, often involving complex symbolism. Celtic art has used a variety of styles and has shown influences from other cultures in their knotwork, spirals, key patterns, lettering, zoomorphics, plant forms and human figures. As the archaeologist Catherine Johns put it: "Common to Celtic art over a wide chronological and geographical span is an exquisite sense of balance in the layout and development of patterns. Curvilinear forms are set out so that positive and negative, filled areas and spaces form a harmonious whole. Control and restraint were exercised in the use of surface texturing and relief. Very complex curvilinear patterns were designed to cover  precisely the most awkward and irregularly shaped surfaces".[5]Contents1 Background2 Pre-Celtic periods3 Iron Age; Early Celtic art3.1 Hallstatt gallery4 La Tène style5 Early Middle Ages5.1 Post-Roman Ireland and Britain5.2 Picts (Scotland)6 Celtic revival7 Celtic art types and terms8 See also9 Notes10 References10.1 Further reading11 External linksBackground[edit]The ancient peoples now called "Celts" spoke a group of languages that had a common origin in the Indo-European language known as Common Celtic or Proto-Celtic. This shared linguistic origin was once widely accepted by scholars to indicate peoples with a common genetic origin in southwest Europe, who had spread their culture by emigration and invasion. Archaeologists identified various cultural traits of these peoples, including styles of art, and traced the culture to the earlier Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture. More recent genetic studies have indicated that various Celtic groups do not all have shared ancestry, and have suggested a diffusion and spread of the culture without necessarily involving significant movement of peoples.[6] The extent to which "Celtic" language, culture and genetics coincided and interacted during prehistoric periods remains very uncertain and controversial. Carved stone ball from Towie in Aberdeenshire, dated from 3200 to 2500 BC[7]Celtic art is associated with the peoples known as Celts; those who spoke the Celtic languages in Europe from pre-history through to the modern period, as well as the art of ancient peoples whose language is uncertain, but have cultural and stylistic similarities with speakers of Celtic languages.The term "Celt" was used in classical times as a synonym for the Gauls (Κελτοι, Celtae). Its English form is modern, attested from 1607. In the late 17th century the work of scholars such as Edward Lhuyd brought academic attention to the historic links between Gaulish and the Brythonic—and Goidelic—speaking peoples, from which point the term was applied not just to continental Celts but those in Britain and Ireland.Then in the 18th century the interest in "primitivism", which led to the idea of the "noble savage", brought a wave of enthusiasm for all things Celtic and Druidic. The "Irish revival" came after the Catholic Emancipation Act of 1829 as a conscious attempt to demonstrate an Irish national identity, and with its counterpart in other countries subsequently became the "Celtic Revival".Pre-Celtic periods[edit]The earliest archaeological culture that is conventionally termed Celtic, the Hallstatt culture (from "Hallstatt C" onwards), comes from the early European Iron Age, c. 800–450 BC.  Nonetheless, the art of this and later periods reflects considerable continuity, and some long-term correspondences, with earlier art from the same regions, which may reflect the emphasis in recent scholarship on "Celticization" by acculturation among a relatively static population, as opposed to older theories of migrations and invasions.  Megalithic art across much of the world uses a similar mysterious vocabulary of circles, spirals and other curved shapes, but it is striking that the most numerous remains in Europe are the large monuments, with many rock drawings left by the Neolithic Boyne Valley culture in Ireland, within a few miles of centres for Early Medieval Insular art some 4,000 years later.  Other centres such as Brittany are also in areas that remain defined as Celtic today.  Other correspondences are between the gold lunulas and large collars of Bronze Age Ireland and Europe and the torcs of Iron Age Celts, all elaborate ornaments worn round the neck.  The trumpet shaped terminations of various types of Bronze Age Irish jewellery are also reminiscent of motifs popular in later Celtic decoration.Iron Age; Early Celtic art[edit] Stone head from Mšecké Žehrovice, Czech Republic, wearing a torc, late La Tène cultureUnlike the rural culture of Iron Age inhabitants of the modern "Celtic nations", Continental Celtic culture in the Iron Age featured many large fortified settlements, some very large, for which the Roman word for "town", oppidum, is now used.  The elites of these societies had considerable wealth, and imported large and expensive, sometimes frankly flashy, objects from neighbouring cultures, some of which have been recovered from graves.  The work of the German émigré to Oxford, Paul Jacobsthal, remains the foundation of the study of the art of the period, especially his Early Celtic Art of 1944.[8]The Halstatt culture produced art with geometric ornament, but marked by patterns of straight lines and rectangles rather than curves; the patterning is often intricate, and fills all the space available, and at least in this respect looks forward to later Celtic styles.  Linguists are generally satisfied that the Halstatt culture originated among people speaking Celtic languages, but art historians often avoid describing Halstatt art as "Celtic".As Halstatt society became increasingly rich and, despite being entirely land-locked in its main zone, linked by trade to other cultures, especially in the Mediterranean, imported objects in radically different styles begin to appear, even including Chinese silks. A famous example is the Greek krater from the Vix Grave in Burgundy, which was made in Magna Graecia (the Greek south of Italy) c. 530 BC, some decades before it was deposited.  It is a huge bronze wine-mixing vessel, with a capacity of 1,100 litres.[9]  Another huge Greek vessel in the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave is decorated with three recumbent lions lying on the rim, one of which is a replacement by a Celtic artist that makes little attempt to copy the Greek style of the others.[10]  Forms characteristic of Hallstatt culture can be found as far from the main Central European area of the culture as Ireland, but mixed with local types and styles.[11] Sculpture from Roquepertuse, including "skull-niches" and seated figuresFigures of animals and humans do appear, especially in works with a religious element. Among the most spectacular objects are "cult wagons" in bronze, which are large wheeled trolleys containing crowded groups of standing figures, sometimes with a large bowl mounted on a shaft at the centre of the platform, probably for offerings to gods; a few examples have been found in graves. The figures are relatively simply modelled, without much success in detailed anatomical naturalism compared to cultures further south, but often achieving an impressive effect.  There are also a number of single stone figures, often with a "leaf crown" — two flattish rounded projections, "resembling a pair of bloated commas", rising behind and to the side of the head, probably a sign of divinity.[12]Human heads alone, without bodies, are far more common, frequently appearing in relief on all sorts of objects. In the La Tène period faces often (along with bird's heads) emerge from decoration that at first looks abstract, or plant-based.  Games are played with faces that change when they are viewed from different directions.  In figures showing the whole body, the head is often over-large.  There is evidence that the human head had a special importance in Celtic religious beliefs.[13]The most elaborate ensembles of stone sculpture, including reliefs, come from southern France, at Roquepertuse and Entremont, close to areas colonized by the Greeks. It is possible that similar groups in wood were widespread. Roquepertuse seems to have been a religious sanctuary, whose stonework includes what are thought to have been niches where the heads or skulls of enemies were placed.  These are dated to the 3rd century BC, or sometimes earlier.In general, the number of high-quality finds is not large, especially when compared to the number of survivals from the contemporary Mediterranean cultures, and there is a very clear division between elite objects and the much plainer goods used by the majority of the people.  There are many torcs and swords (the La Tène site produced over 3,000 swords, apparently votive offerings[14]), but the best-known finds, like the Czech head above, the shoe plaques from Hochdorf and the Waterloo Helmet, often have no similar other finds for comparison.  Clearly religious content in art is rare, but little is known about the significance that most of the decoration of practical objects had for its makers, and the subject and meaning of the few objects without a practical function is equally unclear.Hallstatt gallery[edit]Late Hallstatt gold collar from Austria, c. 550 BCGold shoe plaques from the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave, Germany, c. 530 BCPottery from Heuneburg, GermanyThe imported Greek Vix Krater, found in the Vix Grave, France.La Tène style[edit] Torc from the Vix Grave, 480 BCAbout 500 BC the La Tène style, named after a site in Switzerland, appeared rather suddenly, coinciding with some kind of societal upheaval that involved a shift of the major centres in a north-westerly direction.  The central area where rich sites are especially found is in northern France and western Germany, but over the next three centuries the style spread very widely, as far as Ireland, Italy[15] and modern Hungary.  In some places the Celts were aggressive raiders and invaders, but elsewhere the spread of Celtic material culture may have involved only small movements of people, or none at all.  Early La Tène style adapted ornamental motifs from foreign cultures into something distinctly new; the complicated brew of influences including Scythian art and that of the Greeks and Etruscans among others. The occupation by the Persian Achaemenid Empire of Thrace and Macedonia around 500 BC is a factor of uncertain importance.[16]  La Tène style is "a highly stylised curvilinear art based mainly on classical vegetable and foliage motifs such as leafy palmette forms, vines, tendrils and lotus flowers together with spirals, S-scrolls, lyre and trumpet shapes".[17]The most lavish objects, whose imperishable materials tend to mean they are the best preserved other than pottery, do not refute the stereotypical views of the Celts that are found in classical authors, where they are represented as mainly interested in feasting and fighting, as well as ostentatious display.  Society was dominated by a warrior aristocracy and military equipment, even if in ceremonial versions, and containers for drink, represent most of the largest and most spectacular finds, other than jewellery.[18] Unfortunately for the archaeologist, the rich "princely" burials characteristic of the Hallstatt period greatly reduce, at least partly because of a change from inhumation burials to cremation.[19]The torc was evidently a key marker of status and very widely worn, in a range of metals no doubt reflecting the wealth and status of the owner.  Bracelets and armlets were also common.[20]  An exception to the general lack of depictions of the human figure, and of the failure of wooden objects to survive, are certain water sites from which large numbers of small carved figures of body parts or whole human figures have been recovered, which are assumed to be votive offerings representing the location of the ailment of the supplicant.  The largest of these, at Source-de-la-Roche, Chamalières, France, produced over 10,000 fragments, mostly now at Clermont-Ferrand.[21] Bronze fitting from France in the "vegetal" styleSeveral phases of the style are distinguished, under a variety of names, including numeric (De Navarro) and alphabetic series. Generally, there is broad agreement on how to demarcate the phases, but the names used differ, and that they followed each other in chronological sequence is now much less certain.  In a version of Jacobsthal's division, the "early" or "strict" phase, De Navarro I, where the imported motifs remain recognisable, is succeeded by the "vegetal", "Continuous Vegetal", "Waldalgesheim style", or De Navarro II, where ornament is "typically dominated by continuously moving tendrils of various types, twisting and turning in restless motion across the surface".[12]After about 300 BC the style, now De Navarro III, can be divided into "plastic" and "sword" styles, the latter mainly found on scabbards and the former featuring decoration in high relief.  One scholar, Vincent Megaw, has defined a "Disney style" of cartoon-like animal heads within the plastic style, and also an "Oppida period art, c 125–c 50 BC".  De Navarro distinguishes the "insular" art of the British Isles, up to about 100 BC, as Style IV, followed by a Style V,[22] and the separateness of Insular Celtic styles is widely recognised.[23] The Great Torc from Snettisham, England, 1st century BC.The often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other "foreign" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic.  So a torc in the rich Vix Grave terminates in large balls in a way found in many others, but here the ends of the ring are formed as the paws of a lion or similar beast, without making a logical connection to the balls, and on the outside of the ring two tiny winged horses sit on finely worked plaques. The effect is impressive but somewhat incongruous compared to an equally ostentatious British torc from the Snettisham Hoard that is made 400 years later and uses a style that has matured and harmonized the elements making it up.  The 1st century BC Gundestrup cauldron, is the largest surviving piece of European Iron Age silver (diameter 69 cm, height 42 cm), but though much of its iconography seems clearly to be Celtic, much of it is not, and its style is much debated; it may well be of Thracian manufacture.  To further confuse matters, it was found in a bog in north Denmark.[24]  The Agris Helmet in gold leaf over bronze clearly shows the Mediterranean origin of its decorative motifs.By the 3rd century BC Celts began to produce coinage, imitating Greek and later Roman types, at first fairly closely, but gradually allowing their own taste to take over, so that versions based on sober classical heads sprout huge wavy masses of hair several times larger than their faces, and horses become formed of a series of vigorously curved elements.A form apparently unique to southern Britain was the mirror with a handle and complex decoration, mostly engraved, on the back of the bronze plate; the front side being highly polished to act as the mirror. Each of the more than 50 mirrors found has a unique design, but the essentially circular shape of the mirror presumably dictated the sophisticated abstract curvilinear motifs that dominate their decoration.[25]Despite the importance of Ireland for Early Medieval Celtic art, the number of artefacts showing La Tène style found in Ireland is small, though they are often of very high quality.  Some aspects of Hallstatt metalwork had appeared in Ireland, such as scabbard chapes, but the La Tène style is not found in Ireland before some point between 350 and 150 BC, and until the latter date is mostly found in modern Northern Ireland, notably in a series of engraved scabbard plates. Thereafter, despite Ireland remaining outside the Roman Empire that engulfed the Continental and British Celtic cultures, Irish art is subject to continuous influence from outside, through trade and probably periodic influxes of refugees from Britain, both before and after the Roman invasion.  It remains uncertain whether some of the most notable objects found from the period were made in Ireland or elsewhere, as far away as Germany and Egypt in specific cases.[26] The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan, 2nd century AD Romano-British, with enamel.But in Scotland and the western parts of Britain where the Romans and later the Anglo-Saxons were largely held back, versions of the La Tène style remained in use until it became an important component of the new Insular style that developed to meet the needs of newly Christianized populations.  Indeed, in northern England and Scotland most finds post-date the Roman invasion of the south.[27] However, while there are fine Irish finds from the 1st and 2nd centuries, there is little or nothing in La Tène style from the 3rd and 4th centuries, a period of instability in Ireland.[28]After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalized styles.  Roman Britain produced a number of items using Roman forms such as the fibula but with La Tène style ornament, whose dating can be difficult,[29] for example a "hinged brass collar" from around the time of the Roman conquest shows Celtic decoration in a Roman context.[30]  Britain also made more use of  enamel than most of the Empire, and on larger objects, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom derived from Insular decoration was an important element.  Enamel decoration on penannular brooches, "dragonesque" brooches,[31] and hanging bowls appears to demonstrate a continuity in Celtic decoration between works like the Staffordshire Moorlands Pan and the flowering of Christian Insular art from the 6th century onwards.Continental examplesGold mounts on a bowl, adapting Mediterranean motifs, Germany, c. 420BCDisc brooch, France, 4th century BCParade Helmet, Agris, France, 350 BC, decorated in a mixture of Mediterranean stylesStater coin of the Parisii tribe, 100-50 BC.British examplesThe Battersea Shield, England, 350-50 BC, for display rather than combat.The Wandsworth Shield-boss, in the "plastic" styleBronze mount in British "Disney style", 10 cm high, 1st century ADThe Waterloo Helmet,  a unique find, probably not worn in battle. The Tara BroochEarly Middle Ages[edit]Main article: Insular art Folio 27r from the 8th-century Lindisfarne Gospels contains the incipit Liber generationis of the Gospel of Matthew.Post-Roman Ireland and Britain[edit]Celtic art in the Middle Ages was practiced by the peoples of Ireland and parts of Britain in the 700-year period from the Roman withdrawal from Britain in the 5th century, to the establishment of Romanesque art in the 12th century.  Through the Hiberno-Scottish mission the style was influential in the development of art throughout Northern Europe.In Ireland an unbroken Celtic heritage existed from before and throughout the Roman era of Britain, which had never reached the island, though in fact Irish objects in La Tène style are very rare from the Late Roman period.  The 5th to 7th centuries were a continuation of late Iron Age La Tène art, with also many signs of the Roman and Romano-British influences that had gradually penetrated there.[32]  With the arrival of Christianity, Irish art was influenced by both Mediterranean and Germanic traditions, the latter through Irish  contacts with the Anglo-Saxons, creating what is called the Insular or Hiberno-Saxon style, which had its golden age in the 8th and early 9th centuries before Viking raids severely disrupted monastic life.  Late in the period Scandinavian influences were added through the Vikings and mixed Norse-Gael populations, then original Celtic work came to end with the Norman invasion in 1169–1170 and the subsequent introduction of the general European Romanesque style.[citation needed]In the 7th and 9th centuries Irish Celtic missionaries travelled to Northumbria in Britain and brought with them the Irish tradition of manuscript illumination, which came into contact with Anglo-Saxon metalworking knowledge and motifs. In the monasteries of Northumbria these skills fused and were probably transmitted back to Scotland and Ireland from there, also influencing the Anglo-Saxon art of the rest of England. Some of the metalwork masterpieces created include the Tara Brooch, the Ardagh Chalice and the Derrynaflan Chalice. New techniques employed were filigree and chip carving, while new motifs included interlace patterns and animal ornamentation. The Book of Durrow is the earliest complete insular script illuminated Gospel Book and by about 700,  with the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Hiberno-Saxon style was fully developed with detailed carpet pages that seem to glow with a wide palette of colours. The art form reached its peak in the late 8th century with the Book of Kells, the most elaborate Insular manuscript.  Anti-classical Insular artistic styles were carried to mission centres on the Continent and had a continuing impact on Carolingian, Romanesque and Gothic art for the rest of the Middle Ages.In the 9th and 11th century plain silver became a popular medium in Anglo-Saxon England, probably because of the increased amount in circulation due to Viking trading and raiding, and it was during this time a number of magnificent silver penannular brooches were created in Ireland. Around the same time manuscript production began to decline, and although it has often been blamed on the Vikings, this is debatable given the decline began before the Vikings arrived. Sculpture began to flourish in the form of the "high cross", large stone crosses that held biblical scenes in carved relief. This art form reached its apex in the early 10th century and has left many fine examples such as Muiredach's Cross at Monasterboice and the Ahenny High Cross. Christ in Majesty, Book of Kells.The impact of the Vikings on Irish art is not seen until the late 11th century when Irish metal work begins to imitate the Scandinavian Ringerike and Urnes styles, for example the Cross of Cong and Shrine of Manchan. These influences were found not just in the Norse centre of Dublin, but throughout the countryside in stone monuments such as the Dorty Cross at Kilfenora and crosses at the Rock of Cashel.[33]Some Insular manuscripts may have been produced in Wales, including the 8th century Lichfield Gospels and Hereford Gospels.[34]  The late Insular Ricemarch Psalter from the 11th century was certainly written in Wales, and also shows strong Viking influence.Art from historic Dumnonia, modern Cornwall, Devon, Somerset and Brittany on the Atlantic seaboard is now fairly sparsely attested and hence less well known as these areas later became incorporated into England (and France) in the medieval and Early Modern period.[35] However archaeological studies at sites such as Cadbury Castle, Somerset,[36] Tintagel,[37] and more recently at Ipplepen[38] indicate a highly sophisticated largely literate society with strong influence and connections with both the Byzantine Mediterranean as well as the Atlantic Irish, and British in Wales and the 'Old North'. Many crosses, memorials and tombstones such as King Doniert's Stone,[39] the Drustanus stone and the notorious Artognou stone show evidence for a surprisingly cosmopolitan sub-Roman population speaking and writing in both Brittonic and Latin and with at least some knowledge of Ogham indicated by several extant stones in the region. Breton and especially Cornish manuscripts are exceedingly rare survivals but include the Bodmin manumissions[40] demonstrating a regional form of the Insular style.  King Doniert's Stone, c.875Picts (Scotland)[edit]From the 5th to the mid-9th centuries, the art of the Picts is primarily known through stone sculpture, and a smaller number of pieces of metalwork, often of very high quality; there are no known illuminated manuscripts.  The Picts shared modern Scotland with a zone of Irish cultural influence on the west coast, including Iona, and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria to the south.  After Christianization, Insular styles heavily influenced Pictish art, with interlace prominent in both metalwork and stones.The heavy silver Whitecleuch Chain has Pictish symbols on its terminals, and appears to be an equivalent to a torc. The symbols are also found on plaques from the Norrie's Law hoard. These are thought to be relatively early pieces.  The St Ninian's Isle Treasure of silver penannular brooches, bowls and other items comes from off the coast of Pictland and is often regarded as mostly of Pictish manufacture, representing the best survival of Late Pictish metalwork, from about 800 AD.Pictish stones are assigned by scholars to 3 classes.  Class I Pictish stones are unshaped standing stones incised with a series of about 35 symbols which include abstract designs (given descriptive names such as crescent and V-rod, double disc and Z-rod, 'flower' and so on by researchers); carvings of recognisable animals (bull, eagle, salmon, adder and others), as well as the Pictish Beast, and objects from daily life (a comb, a mirror).  The symbols almost always occur in pairs, with in about one-third of cases the addition of the mirror, or mirror and comb, symbol, below the others.  This is often taken to symbolise a woman.  Apart from one or two outliers, these stones are found exclusively in north-east Scotland from the Firth of Forth to Shetland.  Good examples include the Dunnichen and Aberlemno stones (Angus), and the Brandsbutt and Tillytarmont stones (Aberdeenshire). Pictish symbols and a rider on a Pictish stoneClass II stones are shaped cross-slabs carved in relief, or in a combination of incision and relief, with a prominent cross on one, or in rare cases two, faces.  The crosses are elaborately decorated with interlace, key-pattern or scrollwork, in the Insular style.  On the secondary face of the stone, Pictish symbols appear, often themselves elaborately decorated, accompanied by figures of people (notably horsemen), animals both realistic and fantastic, and other scenes.  Hunting scenes are common, Biblical motifs less so.  The symbols often appear to 'label' one of the human figures.  Scenes of battle or combat between men and fantastic beasts may be scenes from Pictish mythology.  Good examples include slabs from Dunfallandy and Meigle (Perthshire), Aberlemno (Angus), Nigg, Shandwick and Hilton of Cadboll (Easter Ross).Class III stones are in the Pictish style, but lack the characteristic symbols.  Most are cross-slabs, though there are also recumbent stones with sockets for an inserted cross or small cross-slab (e.g. at Meigle, Perthshire).  These stones may date largely to after the Scottish takeover of the Pictish kingdom in the mid 9th century.  Examples include the sarcophagus and the large collection of cross-slabs at St Andrews (Fife).The following museums have important collections of Pictish stones: Meigle (Perthshire), St Vigeans (Angus) and St Andrew's Cathedral (Fife) (all Historic Scotland), the Museum of Scotland, Edinburgh (which also exhibits almost all the major pieces of surviving Pictish metalwork), the Meffan Institute, Forfar (Angus), Inverness Museum, Groam House Museum, Rosemarkie and Tarbat Discovery Centre, Portmahomack (both Easter Ross) and The Orkney Museum in Kirkwall.Celtic revival[edit] Cover of The Boys' Cuchulain, 1904, in fact closer to Viking Urnes style.Main article: Celtic RevivalThe revival of interest in Celtic visual art came sometime later than the revived interest in Celtic literature.  By the 1840s reproduction Celtic brooches and other forms of metalwork were fashionable, initially in Dublin, but later in Edinburgh, London and other countries.  Interest was stimulated by the discovery in 1850 of the Tara Brooch, which was seen in London and Paris over the next decades.  The late 19th century reintroduction of monumental Celtic crosses for graves and other memorials has arguably been the most enduring aspect of the revival, one that has spread well outside areas and populations with a specific Celtic heritage. Interlace typically features on these and has also been used as a style of architectural decoration, especially in America around 1900, by architects such as Louis Sullivan, and in stained glass and wall stenciling by Thomas A. O'Shaughnessy, both based in Chicago with its large Irish-American population.  The "plastic style" of early Celtic art was one of the elements feeding into Art Nouveau decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the Manxman Archibald Knox, who did much work for Liberty & Co.The Arts and Crafts Movement in Ireland embraced the Celtic style early on, but began to back away in the 1920s. The governor of the National Gallery of Ireland, Thomas Bodkin, writing in The Studio magazine in 1921, drew attention to the decline in Celtic ornament in the Sixth Exhibition of the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland said, "National art all over the world has burst long ago, the  narrow boundaries within which it is cradled, and grows more cosmopolitan in spirit with each succeeding generation." George Atkinson, writing the foreword to the catalogue of that same exhibit emphasized the society's disapproval of any undue emphasis on Celtic ornament at the expense of good design. "Special pleading on behalf of the national traditional ornament is no longer justifiable.”The style had served the nationalist cause as an emblem of a distinct Irish culture, but soon intellectual fashions abandoned Celtic art as nostalgically looking backwards.[41]Interlace, which is still seen as a "Celtic" form of decoration—somewhat ignoring its Germanic origins and equally prominent place in Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian medieval art—has remained a motif in many forms of popular design, especially in Celtic countries, and above all Ireland, where it remains a national style signature. In recent decades it has been used worldwide in tattoos, and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi-Dark Ages setting. The Secret of Kells is an animated feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the Book of Kells which makes much use of Insular design.By the 1980s a new Celtic Revival had begun, which continues to this day. Often this late 20th-century movement is referred to as the Celtic Renaissance.[42] By the 1990s the number of new artists, craftsmen, designers and retailers specializing in Celtic jewelry and crafts was rapidly increasing. The Celtic Renaissance has been an international phenomenon, with participants no longer confined to just the Old-World Celtic countries.[43]June 9 was designated International Day of Celtic Art in 2017 by a groups of contemporary Celtic artists and enthusiasts. The day is an occasion for exhibits, promotions, workshops and demonstrations.[44]Celtic art types and terms[edit] A hanging bowl from Sutton HooHanging bowl. According to the traditional theory, these were created by Celtic craftsmen during the time of the Anglo-Saxon conquests of England. They were based on a Roman design, usually made of copper alloy with 3 or 4 suspension loops along the top rim, from which they were designed to be hung, perhaps from roof-beams or within a tripod. Their art-historical interest mainly derives from the round decorated plaques, often with enamel, that most have along their rims.  Some of the finest examples are found in the hoard at Sutton Hoo (625) which are enamelled. The knowledge of their manufacture spread to Scotland and Ireland in the 8th century. However, although their styles continue popular Romano-British traditions, the assumption that they were made in Ireland is now questioned.Carpet page. An illuminated manuscript page decorated entirely in ornamentation. In Hiberno-Saxon tradition this was a standard feature of Gospel books, with one page as an introduction to each Gospel. Usually made in a geometric or interlace pattern, often framing a central cross. The earliest known example is the 7th century Bobbio Orosius.High cross. A tall stone standing cross, usually of Celtic cross form.  Decoration is abstract often with figures in carved relief, especially crucifixions, but in some cases complex multi-scene schemes.  Most common in Ireland, but also in Great Britain and near continental mission centres.Pictish stone. A cross-slab—a rectangular slab of rock with a cross carved in relief on the slab face, with other pictures and shapes carved throughout. Organised into three Classes, based on the period of origin.Insular art or the Hiberno-Saxon style, from the 6th to 9th centuries. The fusion of pre-Christian Celtic and Anglo-Saxon metalworking styles, applied to the new form of the religious illuminated manuscript, as well as sculpture and secular and church metalwork.  Also includes influences from post-classical Europe, and later Viking decorative styles.  The peak of the style in manuscripts occurred when Irish Celtic missionaries traveled to Northumbria in the 7th and 8th centuries. Produced some of the most outstanding Celtic art of the Middle Ages in illuminated manuscripts, metalworking and sculpture.Celtic calendar. The oldest material Celtic calendar is the fragmented Gaulish Coligny calendar from the 1st century BC or AD.See also[edit]List of Hiberno-Saxon illustrated manuscriptsGundestrup cauldronCeltic mazeCeltic blueNotes[edit]^ Megaws, for example; see their introductory section, where they explain the situation & that their article will only cover the La Tène period.^ "Technologies of Enchantment: Early Celtic Art in Britain".

Sagitta elegans). Body of adult animal can grow up to 45 mm, is narrow, firm and opaque (this image: animal very see-through. Visible opaque animal needs better picture).Fins are separated, rounded, and completely rayed. Anterior fins beginning below the ventral ganglion. Alimentary diverticula present. Eyes with small, round pigment spot. Ovaries long and narrow. Seminal vesicles conical in shape, either exactly next to or very close to the tail fin, separated from posterior fins.For anatomy, reproduction, classification, and fossil record; see ChaetognathaTaxonomy[edit]Three subspecies are recognised - Sagitta elegans arctica, Sagitta elegans baltica and Sagitta elegans elegans.[1] The subspecies are considered to vary in size depending on the temperature of the waters in which they develop, which could be an indication of them being synonymous species. The numbers of hooks and teeth vary slightly in the three subspecies.[2]Ecology[edit]General[edit]With exception for the benthic species Spadella, arrow worms are all adapted for planktonic existence. They swim to the surface at night when it is safer for them to hunt, and descend during daytime. Most of the time they drift passively, but they can dart forward in swift spurts, using their caudal fin and longitudinal muscles. Horizontal fins bordering the trunk serve largely as stabilizers, and are used in flotation rather than in active swimming.Distribution[edit]Parasagitta elegans and the three subspecies occur in Arctic and subarctic waters. S. elegans elegans is a coastal subspecies with oceanic influence. S. elegans arctica is a boreal-arctic form, and S. elegans baltica is the smallest form, found only in or near the Baltic Sea.[3] All subspecies are typically found in waters 0-200m deep.[4]References[edit]^ Thuesen, Erik V.

Under the Childers Reforms it amalgamated with the 106th Bombay Light Infantry to form the Durham Light Infantry in 1881, the 68th Regiment becoming the 1st Battalion, and the 106th Regiment becoming the 2nd Battalion in the regular Army. It saw action during the Seven Years' War before being converted to Light Infantry in 1808, fighting with distinction in the Peninsular Army under Arthur Wellesley. It would go on to fight with some distinction during the Crimean War, served during the Indian Mutiny and the New Zealand wars before returning to India between 1872 and 1888.Contents1 Formation2 The Seven Years War3 The West Indies4 Walcheren5 The Peninsular War5.1 Salamanca5.2 Vitoria5.3 Pyrenees5.4 Nivelle5.5 Orthez6 1814–18547 Crimean War7.1 Inkerman7.2 Awards8 India9 New Zealand10 1866–188111 Victoria Cross11.1 Private John Byrne11.2 Captain Thomas de Courcy Hamilton11.3 Sgt John Murray12 Battle honours13 Colonels14 Notes15 References16 Bibliography17 External linksFormation[edit]In August 1756, after the loss of Minorca in the Seven Years' War, the 23rd Regiment of Foot, together with 14 other regiments was ordered to raise a 2nd Battalion, which it did while in Leicester.[6] On 22 April 1758 the 2nd battalion was separated from the 23rd regiment as a new regiment and ranked as the 68th in order of precedence with the appointment of a new colonel as Lambton's Regiment of Foot or the 68th Regiment of foot.[7] (The practice of referring to regiments by their colonel's name was gradually going out of fashion, being replaced by the regiments' order of precedence.[8])The Seven Years War[edit]In May 1758 it marched to the Isle of Wight as part of the forces (14,000 soldiers in five brigades and 6,000 marines) stationed on the island at the request of Britain's ally Frederick the Great of Prussia. The intention was to conduct raids (descents as they were then called) on the French coast to disturb privateers in the area, distract the French army and relieve pressure on Britain's allies, the Prussians.[9] The first expedition (3 Guards, 9 line regiments[10]) anchored at Cancale Bay, near St Malo, on 5 May, the grenadier company being part of the forces that destroyed four King's ships, 60 merchantmen and several privateers in Paramé. The remainder of the regiment constructed fortifications around Cancale until taken off on 12 June. After threatening other ports in the region, the fleet returned to Britain on 6 July.[11] A contemporary map of the raid on Cherbourg with French and German notesA second expedition involving the 68th on the French coast was landed on 7 August in the Bay of Ureville and marched for Cherbourg. The town was taken with little resistance from the local militia or the Régiment de Clare, and the fort and harbour were demolished.[12] The troops left on 16 August but did not return to Britain. A third and final expedition was launched on 3 September; the 68th landed at Lunaire Bay, again near St Malo, but suffered severe defeat after the French concentrated their army and engaged the British army at St. Cast. The governor of Brittany, the Duc d'Aiguillon, led a force of 6,000 regulars, several squadrons of cavalry and the "Garde de Cote" militia against the British, who fought a rearguard action while evacuating the beach. The French claimed British casualties were 900 officers and men, with 600 taken prisoner. The 68th lost 70 men from Captain Revell's grenadiers company, who formed part of the rear guard with grenadiers from the other regiments left on the beach.[13]The 68th disembarked at Cowes on 19 September, and in October the regiment marched into winter quarters at Rochester. With losses in expeditions (mostly from the poor conditions aboard ship)[14] and providing a draft of 173 men to the 61st regiment, it was very weak, and recruiting parties scoured the country to refill its ranks.[15] On 2 June 1759, the regiment embarked for Jersey. It arrived on 21 June and remained there until February 1760, returning to England. In March, 600 men of the regiment, in three groups of 200, were drafted into the British regiments in the West Indies; this reduced the regiment to a mere 58 rank and file.[16] The regiment was marched to Leeds, then Newcastle, and billeted at Tynemouth Barracks. At this point, recruiting had enabled it to muster nine (weak) companies consisting of 41 officers and 239 men.[10]There the 68th would remain through 1761, with a detachment sent to Durham to aid civil power and providing a draft of 95 men for the 70th Regiment. By May, the regiment was based at Hexham with its headquarters at Morpeth, with a strength of 42 officers and 289 men. In January 1762, the 68th had grown to 415 men and was ordered to march to Berwick, where it transferred to the command of Lord George Beauclerk, commanding in Scotland (North Britain as it was referred to since the 1745 rebellion). It was quartered at the newly built Fort George and remained throughout 1762, until July 1763 when to was shipped to Ireland.[17][18]The West Indies[edit]In 1764 the regiment left Ireland on 2 June with a strength of just over half the establishment (250 privates, establishment: 423) and sailed for the Caribbean, arriving in Antigua after a swift passage on 21 June.[19] Eight uneventful[a] years passed until mid 1772, when six companies were sent to St. Vincent to fight rebellious Caribs, where more men were sick with diseases (63) than were killed or wounded in fighting (36). It was during this fighting that the motto, 'Faithful' is supposed to have been gained and placed on the colours.[20] Leather cap worn by the 68th Regiment of Foot 1770s from the Durham Light Infantry museumIn March 1773 the regiment left the Caribbean for Britain, where it over-wintered in Tynemouth. In May 1774 it returned to Scotland and Fort George, staying until December 1775, when it moved once more to Ireland.[21] It was while serving in Dublin that disputes with other regiments arose over the motto displayed on the colours (as it could imply that other regiments were less faithful), and the motto was not repeated on later colours.[22] The regiment was to spend seven and a half years deployed around Ireland. Near the end of that time, August 1782, it was decided to attach counties to regiments to aid recruitment, and the 68th was allotted to County Durham, becoming the 68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot.[b][23]In 1779, the regiment was in the news when one of its former officers, James Hackman, was hanged for the notorious murder of Martha Ray, mistress of the Earl of Sandwich.[24]It left Ireland in September, at nearly full strength (793 all ranks), for Portsmouth.[23] In December the regiment was brought up to full strength (a war establishment of 847 all ranks) and was destined for service in Jamaica. News of the Peace of Paris caused a mutiny, especially among those men who had signed up only for 'three years service or the duration', and the regiment was put ashore from the transport ships it was in.[25]After guarding prisoners of war at Winchester, in October the regiment was sent to Jersey and Guernsey. It left, after a brief return to England (June–September 1784), in early October 1785 for Gibraltar, and beiDischarge  • locationmouth[4] • average112 cu ft/s (3.2 m3/s)[4]Basin featuresTributaries  • leftLittle Wood River • rightBig Wood RiverThe Malad River is a river located within Gooding County, and Oneida County, Idaho, Idaho, United States, and is a tributary of the Snake River.Contents1 Description2 See also3 Notes4 References5 External linksDescription[edit]The river is formed by the confluence of the Big Wood River[Note 1] and the Little Wood River near Gooding. From there the river flows south and west for 12.0 miles (19.3 km)[3] to join the Snake River near Hagerman.[1]The river flows through Thousand Springs State Park, where it tumbles down a stairstep waterfall. The Malad Gorge is 250 feet (76 m) deep and 2.5 miles (4.0 km) long.The river's flow is affected by numerous reservoirs and irrigation works on its tributaries. The Malad River itself is largely diverted into a power flume that enters the Snake below the mouth of the Malad, via a powerhouse. Below the diversion the Malad River is replenished by numerous springs, yet the average flow above the diversion is higher than at the river's mouth.[4]The Malad River is part of the Columbia River basin, being a tributary of the Snake River, which is a tributary to the Columbia River.[5]The name of the river stems from French malade, via Rivière aux Malades ('river of the sick'), presumably as a reference to some illness suffered by early French-Canadian trappers who investigated the area.[6]See also[edit]Rivers portalList of rivers of IdahoNotes[edit]^ One of the main tributaries of the Big Wood River is the Camas Creek. What makes that interesting is that one of the tributaries of that Camas Creek (not to be confused with at least four other Camas Creeks in Idaho) is also called the Malad River, thus making that Malad River a tributary of this Malad River.References[edit]^ a b c U.S. Geological Survey Geographic Names Information System: Malad River^ a b Google Earth elevation for GNIS coordinates.^ a b U.S. Geological Survey.

She made memorable contributions to Noreascon III in Boston, the 1989 Worldcon, partnering with Fred Isaacs in conceptualizing the ConCourse, a new feature for Worldcons. A Vice Chair of the 1993 Worldcon, ConFrancisco, she served briefly as Acting Chair after the Chairman died, until a new chairman was appointed. In 1998 she chaired BucConeer, the 56th Worldcon in Baltimore. She served as North American agent for the first Worldcon to be held in Japan, Nippon 2007; in 2010 co-chaired, and 2011 and 2012 chaired the SFWA Nebula Awards Weekends; and was Fan Guest of Honor at Chicon 7, the 70th Worldcon, held in 2012.[1] She co-chaired the 2014 World Fantasy Convention just months before she died due to complications from heart surgery.Contents1 Early life and family2 Marriage, children, and fandom3 Running conventions4 Mowing Peggy Rae's lawn5 Legacy6 Awards7 ReferencesEarly life and family[edit]Sapienza was born on June 28, 1944, outside of Philadelphia, to Jack and Buddie McKnight, both members of the Philadelphia Science Fiction Society (PSFS). Her stepmother, Ann Newell McKnight, was also a member of PSFS, and her stepfather, Bill Evans, was active in the Washington Science Fiction Association (WSFA).When she was 9 years old she watched as her father, Jack McKnight, spent most of the 1953 Worldcon in his metal shop machining the first Hugo Award rockets, which he had been recruited to do at the last minute, making it to the Convention just in time for the Hugo Ceremony. A few years later, at the age of 12, she attended her first science fiction convention, Philcon, with her parents, and at the age of 16, she attended Pittcon, her first World Science Fiction Convention (Worldcon), where she met her future husband, Robert K. (Bob) Pavlat.From the mid-1960s on, Peggy Rae was an active member of WSFA, attended conventions across the country, and often found herself on the con committee.[2] She was active in the PSFS in the late 1950s, where she served as Secretary and Vice President, and she was active in fanzine fandom in the 1960s and beyond.Marriage, children, and fandom[edit]She married fan Bob Pavlat,[3] who was nearly 20 years her senior, in 1964, and they settled into the Washington DC suburbs and had two children, Melissa (Missy) and Eric. Starting in the 1960s she published several fanzines, including 7 issues of "etwas" from 1960 - 1963,[citation needed] Of Cabbages and Kings (and Baby Turtles) 1969–1996, Of Members and Zines (and Egoboo Polls) c 1968 +, and the fapazine Adventures on Earth, 1999–2004.[4]Science fiction was not her only interest; she was also active in local politics, serving as a legislative assistant to Frank Pesci, Maryland State Delegate from Prince George's County,[5] working with the League of Women Voters of Prince George's County, serving as district leader for the 1976 presidential campaign of Mo Udall, and once running for a seat on the County Council. In the 1980s, Maryland Governor Harry Hughes appointed her to the Maryland State Board of Elections, where in January 1995, she cast the tie-breaking vote validating the gubernatorial election of Parris Glendening over Ellen Sauerbrey. Glendening had won by 5993 votes, but Sauerbrey had contested both in court[6] and to the Board.She also served as the president of the Parent-Teacher Association for her children's school for several years in the 1970s, served on the Prince George's County Community Mental Health Advisory Board, volunteered at the Paint Branch Unitarian Universalist Church[7] for twenty years, and volunteered completing taxes for the elderly later in life.In 1963 she served on the Con Committee for the first Worldcon held in Washington DC, Discon I, and she did it again for Discon II in 1974. She continued to serve on Worldcon Con Committees regularly for the next four decades, all over the United States and beyond, including Constellation, in 1983, in Baltimore, Maryland.[8] At Constellation, she was in charge of Programming and Special Events. In that position, she revived the one-off idea from a previous WorldCon[which?] of running an entire schedule of children's programming. Children's programming has since become a staple of WorldCons.[citation needed]Her husband, Bob, died suddenly only months before Constellation. With help from her staff and committee she was able to pull through. She and Bob were jointly awarded the Big Heart Award there, one of fandom's highest honors, but she was now widowed at the age of 38, with 2 children to raise. The following year she went to work as a contractor for the United States government in Washington, D.C., as a UNIX Administrator[8] for OSHA.Running conventions[edit]At Noreascon III in Boston in 1989, she and Fred Isaacs ran the “Second Floor Division", which included Exhibits, Registration, the Dealers’ Room, Information, Press Relations and the Newsletter. She also conceptualized and managed the ConCourse for which Noreascon III was known.[8]She chaired Disclave, the DC Regional SF convention, in 1991: the 9th SMOFCon, held in New Orleans in 1992:[9] and SMOFCon 22, held in Washington DC in 2004.She served as vice-chairman for ConFrancisco, the 1993 Worldcon in San Francisco, stepping in to serve as interim chair when the Chairman died suddenly.Sapienza helped organize the first FanHistoricon, which took place May 1994, in Hagerstown, MD.[10] Her goal was to create some kind of umbrella organization to oversee existing fan history activities, and to come up with ideas for new ones.[11]  FanHistoricon wasn't a convention, it was more of a workshop to establish a structure for the new organization, which became The Society for the Preservation of the History of Science Fiction Fandom, aka the Timebinders.[12]Her many accomplishments in fandom were crowned by her election as Chair of Bucconeer, the 1998 Worldcon in Baltimore, by the Baltimore in 1998 Worldcon Bid Committee.[8] She was instrumental in forming the Baltimore Washington Area Worldcon Association (BWAWA) in the wake of BucConeer. For several years after, BWAWA continued administration of the Young Writers' contest which had been started for BucConeer. As a 501(c)(3) BWAWA was able to sponsor other fannish pursuits such as organizing SFWA's Awards Weekends in 2010 and 2011, and the World Fantasy Convention in 2014. As an Officer of BWAWA, she was a key factor in the formation of DC17, a bid to bring the Worldcon back to Washington DC in 2017, which was launched in October 2013.[13] DC17 lost the site selection vote held at Sasquan in August 2015.She married her second husband John Sapienza, a long-time RPG aficionado who had contributed to TSR's AD&D and Chaosium's RuneQuest, in 1999.[14] Their honeymoon was in Australia, where not unexpectedly, Sapienza was recruited on short notice to coordinate volunteers at AussieCon III.[15]More recently she was on the Bid Committee and represented Nippon, first for their Bid and then as a member of their Con Comm and  North American Agent, which bid for and won the right to hold the 65th World Science Fiction Convention in 2007.[15][16] She not only became reasonably conversant in Japanese but also helped plan the program for the English-speaking portion of the convention. The Japanese language became a lifelong interest; upon her death in 2015, a Japanese-language instructional CD was found inserted in her car's CD player[citation needed].Mowing Peggy Rae's lawn[edit]Sometime in the nineties, when a fan arrived at Sapienza's house early for a con–planning meeting and found her gardening, he pitched in to help, and one by one the other committee members did so too, as they arrived. Joe Mayhew warned people that if Baltimore won the 1998 Worldcon, all the committee members would wind up mowing Peggy Rae's lawn. Thus was born the phrase “I mowed Peggy Rae's Lawn,” which indicated that people were sucked in when Peggy Rae looked at them and said, with a big smile on her face, “You know, I think you would be good at…”  [17]In 2012, at Chicon 7, she was honored as the Fan Guest of Honor. Her display in the Exhibits area consisted of a patch of astroturf surrounded by picket fences and park benches. Sitting in the middle of the patch was a small toy lawnmower, to give everyone at the con the chance to mow Peggy Rae's lawn.Legacy[edit]She and John endowed a scholarship at the University of Maryland, her alma mater, for a student majoring in economics "to help facilitate the education of a hardworking student and encourage him or her toward graduation"[7][18] (Sapienza had graduated summa cum laude with a B.A. in economics).On June 5, 2015, Chicon 7 created the Peggy Rae Sapienza Endowment to benefit the special collections library at Northern Illinois University, using the last of Chicon 7's surplus funds. Chicon 7 Chair Dave McCarty announced the initial endowment of $25,000 during the Nebula Awards Weekend reception  at The Palmer House Hilton in Chicago. The endowment is intended to advance the library's efforts to collect materials related to SF, fantasy, and horror, and to make those materials available to the public.[19]In a tribute to her on his blog, Whatever, John Scalzi wrote: "...I considered Peggy Rae a friend, and deeply admired her competence and her cheerfulness in being so. If Peggy Rae was running things, basically, I felt in safe hands. She’ll be remembered ...by all of science fiction fandom."  [20]Awards[edit]In January 2017 Peggy Rae Sapienza was announced as the recipient of the SFWA's Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award with the following citation: "The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA) is pleased to announce that Peggy Rae Sapienza has been named the recipient of the Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award to honor her activities in support of science fiction and fantasy.The Kate Wilhelm Solstice Award is given by SFWA for distinguished contributions to the science fiction and fantasy community."[21]References[edit]^ "Peggy Rae Sapienza (1944-2015)". file770.com. 2015-03-24.

Mont-ras is approximately 40 minutes from Girona, or 80 minutes from Barcelona.The historic village centre sits just in the initial rise of the Gavarres hills and natural park, while the rest of the district extends across the plain to meet the Mediterranean sea at the rocky bay of El Crit just to the south of Cap Roig looking out to the Formigues Islands. The name Mont(hill)-ras(level) derives from this geographic situation.Although evidence of human habitation dates back to Roman times, the first mention of Mont-ras Torreolla came in the tenth century in reference to a watchtower that stood in at the approximate location of the current church of Saint Esteve (built 1599). Through the middle-ages Mont-ras was part of the domain of the Barons of Palafrugell and was administered as part of Palafrugell until it became a separate municipality in 1858.[4]The elevated older village centre includes the church of Saint Esteve and the Ajuntament and a number of historic houses. The village area also includes a sports centre, library, Torre Jonama primary school (not to be confused with a school of the same name in Palafrugell). Recent developments have extended the municipality with the building of urbanisations of Torre Simone, La Roqueta, Molines and Canyelles. There are a number of factories, commercial units and potteries situated along the C31/C66 Palamós to Girona Road.The municipality includes a number of older fortified masia farms and towers (torres) built against the raiding of the Barbary pirates. The cove of El Crit (The Scream) takes its name from a legend of a local girl killed by pirates.In the hills behind the village are a number of disused mines and quarries along with cork trees that contributed to the local cork-making industries. The Mont-ras plain includes the Ruta de la Petit Tren walking and cycling route linking Mont-ras with the beaches of La Fosca, Castell and Calella de Palafrugell. As a result, the area is popular with walkers and mountain bikers.Mont-ras includes a number of campsites and the tennis club Costa Brava.

This cognitive bias is similar to the illusion of asymmetric insight.Contents1 Experimental support2 Public speaking and stage fright2.1 Studies on public speaking and the illusion of transparency3 The bystander effect4 See also5 ReferencesExperimental support[edit]For her PhD dissertation in psychology at Stanford University, Elizabeth Newton created a simple test that she regarded as an illustration of the phenomenon.[2] She would tap out a well-known song, such as "Happy Birthday" or the national anthem, with her finger and have the test subject guess the song. People usually estimate that the song will be guessed correctly in about 50 percent of the tests, but only 3 percent pick the correct song. The tapper can hear every note and the lyrics in his or her head; however, the observer, with no access to what the tapper is thinking, only hears a rhythmic tapping.[3]Public speaking and stage fright[edit]The illusion of transparency is commonly prominent in public speakers.[4]  It may be increased by the spotlight effect. The speaker has an exaggerated sense of how obvious his or her nervousness about a speech is to the audience.[4] Studies have shown that when the audience is surveyed, the speaker's emotions were not nearly so evident to the crowd as the speaker perceived them to be.[5] Initial anxiety in a public speaking situation can cause stress that, because of the illusion of transparency, the speaker may feel is evident to the listeners. This mistaken perception can cause the speaker to compensate, which he or she then feels is even more obvious to the crowd, and the stress increases in a feedback loop. Awareness of the limits of others' perceptions of one's mental state can help break the cycle and reduce speech anxiety.[5]Studies on public speaking and the illusion of transparency[edit]Kenneth Savitsky and Thomas Gilovich performed two experiments on public speaking anxiety in relation to the illusion of transparency. The first focused on the speaker's perception of his or her anxiety levels versus an observer's perception of the speaker's anxiety levels. The results were as expected: the speaker judged himself or herself more harshly than the observer did.[5]In their second study, Savitsky and Gilovich focused on the connection between the illusion of transparency and the exacerbation of speech anxiety. Participants in this study were divided into three groups: control, reassured, and informed. All were given a topic and had five minutes to prepare a speech in front of a crowd, after which they rated themselves on anxiety, speech quality, and appearance, and observers also rated them on anxiety levels and speech quality. The control group were given no other advance instructions. The reassured and informed groups were both told in advance that it is normal to feel anxiety about giving a speech. The reassured group were told that research indicates they should not worry about this. The informed group were told about the illusion of transparency and that research indicates that emotions are usually not as evident to others as people believe they are. The informed group rated themselves higher in every respect and were also rated higher by the observers. The informed group, understanding that the audience would not be able to perceive their nervousness, had less stress and their speech tended to be better.[5]The bystander effect[edit]Thomas Gilovich, Kenneth Savitsky, and Victoria Husted Medvec believe that this phenomenon is partially the reason for the bystander effect. They found that concern or alarm were not as apparent to observers as the individual experiencing them thought, and that people believed they would be able to read others' expressions better than they actually could.[6]When confronted with a potential emergency, people typically play it cool, adopt a look of nonchalance, and monitor the reactions of others to determine if a crisis is really at hand. No one wants to overreact, after all, if it might not be a true emergency. However, because each individual holds back, looks nonchalant, and monitors the reactions of others, sometimes everyone concludes (perhaps erroneously) that the situation is not an emergency and hence does not require intervention.— Thomas Gilovich, Kenneth Savitsky, and Victoria Husted Medvec, Journal of Personal and Social Psychology, Vol. 75, No. 2See also[edit]List of cognitive biasesPoe's lawReferences[edit]Footnotes^ Shatz, Itamar (2016).

It was one of the most popular classical rhetoric topics,[1][2] and received new impetus under Renaissance humanism.Contents1 Consolatio as a literary genre2 Defining characteristics3 Ancient history4 Reception and influence5 Consolatio tradition6 See also7 ReferencesConsolatio as a literary genre[edit]The Consolatio literary tradition ("consolation" in English) is a broad literary genre encompassing various forms of consolatory speeches, essays, poems, and personal letters. This literary tradition flourished in antiquity, and its origins date back to the fifth century BC. Orators in antiquity often delivered consolatory speeches to comfort mourners at funerals or in cases of public mourning. Friends wrote personal letters consoling each other on the loss of a loved one. These were often highly personal and emotional. In addition to personal offerings of solace, Consolatio works also include philosophical treatises on grief. These works are usually more detached in tone, and many are written in essay format. Many ancient poets even wrote verse in this distinct Consolatio style.  These consolatory works are all called Consolatio because of their similar arguments, topoi, and distinctive rhetorical appeals.[3] Only fragments of early Consolatio works survive, and it is not until Cicero's Tusculan Disputations, Seneca's Ad Marciam, and Boethius' Consolation of Philosophy that a unified character appears. Scholars often view these works as the bedrock of the formal Consolatio tradition. (Fournier, introduction)Defining characteristics[edit]All Consolatio works draw from a relatively narrow range of arguments aimed at offering solace, to allay the distress caused by the death of a loved one, a matter of ill fortuna. The conventional opening of a Consolatio was All must die.[2] The most typical arguments characterizing the Consolatio genre were:[2] "All must die; even the oldest must die; the youngest too must die, and this is as one with the death of the old."[1][2][4]In the post-classical period, an additional Christian consolation was developed.[2] Consolatio works are united by their treatment of bereavement, by unique rhetorical structure and topoi, and by their use of universal themes to offer solace.[4]Ancient history[edit]Some scholars claim the genre arose from the Sophist belief in the healing power of discourse.[3] Others believe it arose as a response to passages of grief found in the works of the Greek poet Homer.Although several ancient writings contain elements of the Consolatio tradition, it was the Academic Crantor of Soli (c. 325- c. 275BC), a member of Plato's Academy, who first constructed his works in a distinct Consolatio Tradition. Although only fragments of his essays have survived, his influence is noted in the works of later writers, particularly Cicero's Tusculan Disputations and Plutarch's Consolation to Apollonius. Crantor advocated metriopatheia, a tactic for dealing with strong emotions.[5] Cicero's Consolatio is widely accepted as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier Consolatio literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic.[3]In the Early Imperial Age, most Consolatio works were constructed within the framework of Stoicism. Seneca the Younger produced the most recognizable examples of Consolatio in his three Consolations, Ad Marciam, Ad Polybium, and Ad Helviam Matrem. The most recognizable example of Consolatio in verse form was written by the pseudo-Ovidian, Consolatio ad Liviam.[3] In Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy, Philosophy herself consoles the author in his sore straits.[4]Other notable examples of the Consolatio tradition from Antiquity: Pontus 4.11 in Ovid's Letters from the Black Sea, Statius’ poem consoling Abascantus on his wife’s death, Apollonius of Tyana, the Emperor Julian, and Libanius. Libanius was also the author of the funeral orations consoling mourners after the death of the Emperor Julian. The Plutarchian Corpus includes three works constructed in the Consolatio tradition: De exilio, Consolatio ad uxorem, Consolatio ad Apollonium.[3]Reception and influence[edit]The Consolatio genre, particularly its distinct tone and topoi, widely influenced other literary genres. Elements of the Consolatio tradition can be found in a plethora of later works, and the tradition continued through the Middle Ages and into the early modern era.[6]Consolatio tradition[edit]In the Middle Ages Christian ideology taught that the distress, and death itself, were punishments for Adam's fall, while conceding that the tribulations of life could be vehicles of divine correction.A return to the ancient view commenced with Petrarch, though the Quattrocento humanist Coluccio Salutati could only offer the solace of friendships and a sense of duty. The 'art of mourning' 's general revival was expressed in many consolatory letters that circulated in manuscript and were soon printed. Among them Gianozzo Manetti's "bitter dialogue"  Antonini, dilectissimi filii sui, morte consolatorius (1438) took the new intimate view of grieving, and Francesco Filelfo offered an extensive compendium of Christian and Classical consolations in his consolatory oration for Antonio Marcello on the death of his son (1461). Marilyn Aronberg Lavin reads Piero della Francesca's gnomic Flagellation of Christ (c 1455–60) as a consolatio of two friends (portrayed) who had each recently lost a son. Laurence Sterne parodied Consolatio and solemn authors in his comic novel Tristram Shandy.[2]See also[edit]Consolation of PhilosophyEulogySeneca's ConsolationsReferences[edit]^ a b Ernst Robert Curtius, European Literature and the Latin Middle Ages, trans.

However, an advancing nimbostratus cloud could have a diffuse precipitation leading edge, so its shaft may be unclear.[citation needed]Developing rain shafts often have a fuzzy, bulbous appearance as they descend. If a source of dry air is present at higher altitude and the air into which the rain is falling is sufficiently warm, then strong, and possibly damaging microbursts are possible as sinking air forms.[1]See also[edit]DownburstVirgaShowerReferences[edit]Wikimedia Commons has media related to Praecipitatio.^ "Rain Shaft has a fuzzy, bulbous appearance".

Returning to Norfolk, Virginia, the sloop-of-war decommissioned 26 June 1842.She recommissioned 27 March 1843, Comdr. Hugh N. Page in command, and departed Norfolk to join the Pacific Squadron under Commodore John D. Sloat. From 1843 to 1845 Levant cruised between Panama and Latin American ports carrying diplomats and dispatches and generally furthering American national policy.Mexican–American War, 1846–47[edit]With the Mexican–American War impending, Levant was ordered to the California coast to protect American citizens and property, and was en route when Mexico declared war on 12 May 1846. The sloop arrived off Monterey, California on 1 July, and six days later a landing force from Levant, Savannah, and Cyane took possession of the recently proclaimed Republic of California.On 23 July, Commodore Sloat relinquished command of the Pacific Squadron because of illness, and sailed 29 July in Levant for the east coast. Upon arriving at Norfolk on 28 April 1847, the sloop was placed in ordinary.Mediterranean, 1852–1855[edit]Levant was recommissioned on 12 July 1852, Comdr. George P. Upshur in command, and sailed for the Mediterranean. When Commander Upshur died on board Levant off Spezia, Italy on 3 November, Comdr. Louis M. Goldsborough, later to win fame in the American Civil War, took command. On 7 April 1853 at Leghorn, Italy, Levant loaded statues by American sculptor Horatio Greenough, including one of George Washington, destined for the Capitol at Washington, D.C. After embarking the U.S. Minister to Turkey and his family at Piraeus, Greece on 24 June, Levant sailed to Constantinople, arriving on 5 July. Returning to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 29 April 1855, Levant decommissioned at New York Navy Yard on 4 May.East India Squadron, 1855–58[edit] Attack on the Barrier Forts on 21 November, showing Portsmouth, and Levant, with men and officers from the steam frigate San JacintoSee also: Battle of the Pearl River FortsRecommissioned on 31 October, Comdr. William N. Smith in command, Levant sailed on 13 November for Rio de Janeiro, the Cape of Good Hope, and Hong Kong, where she arrived to join the East India Squadron on 12 May 1856. On 1 July she embarked the U.S. Commissioner to China for transportation to Shanghai, arriving 1 August. At the outbreak of hostilities between the British and the Chinese, Levant arrived Whampoa on 28 October. Comdr. Andrew H. Foote then sent a landing party from Levant and his own ship, Portsmouth, to Canton to protect American lives and property there. On 15 November, while in the process of withdrawing this force, Commander Foote was fired on while passing in a small boat by the "Barrier Forts" on the Pearl River below Canton. On the 16th Levant was towed upriver to join Portsmouth and San Jacinto in keeping the Pearl open to American shipping. As the forts were being strengthened in disregard of American neutrality, Foote was ordered by Commodore James Armstrong, commanding the squadron, "to take such measures as his judgment would dictate... even the capture of the forts."Commander Foote complied with all the dash and courage for which he became famous during the Civil War. On 20 November he took the first fort by leading an amphibious assault with 300 men, then silenced the second with cannon captured from the first. Next day he took the third, and by the 24th all four were in American hands and the Pearl once again safe for American shipping.Levant, close in through most of the action, received the major part of the Chinese bombardment, with 22 shot holes in her hull and rigging, one man dead, and six injured. Destruction of the earthworks was completed by 5 December, and Levant cruised between Hong Kong and Shanghai until she departed Hong Kong on 7 December 1857 for home, arriving at the Boston Navy Yard 6 April 1858.Pacific Squadron, 1859–60[edit]After repairs into 1859, Levant, Comdr. William E. Hunt in command, sailed on 15 June for the Pacific, arriving at Valparaíso, Chile on 11 October, to serve as Pacific Squadron flagship, wearing Commodore John B. Montgomery's broad pennant, through December. In January 1860 Levant sailed for the coast of Nicaragua, where she relieved Saranac and began five months of showing the flag off the coasts of Central and South America.In May 1860, Levant was ordered to the Hawaiian Islands at the request of the Secretary of State to investigate the disbursement of relief funds to American merchant seamen. After receiving a state visit by King Kamehameha IV at Honolulu on 7 May, and investigating at Lahaina, Maui, and Hilo, Hawaii, Levant sailed for Panama on 18 September 1860, but never made port.Disappearance[edit]Commodore Montgomery reported that a violent hurricane had occurred in September 1860 in a part of the Pacific Ocean which Levant was to cross. In June 1861, a mast and a part of a lower yardarm believed to be from Levant were found near Hilo. Spikes had been driven into the mast as if to form a raft. Rumors also circulated that she had run aground on an uncharted reef off California.[1]In July 1861, a small bottle was found at Cape Sable Island, Nova Scotia.  It was corked and contained a card that read in part:  "Pacific Ocean" "Levant"  "Written by the last remaining" "three" "in a boat" "God forgive us".  Unfortunately, the card was damaged when it was removed from the bottle and parts of the message were unreadable.  This card was in the possession of Thomas Willett of Pubnico, Nova Scotia, in 1862, who lost a son aboard this vessel.[2](How? Further information is needed).On 24 July 1861, the United States Congress passed a law to compensate the widows and orphan children of the officers, seamen, marines and others who were lost with the Levant. The law made a provision for accounts paid and received by the ship's purser, Andrew J. Watson, which were to be settled. The law was included in the "Private Acts" section of the statutes book.[3]   The deaths of the officers of Levant were recorded in the Navy Register of 1863 as occurring on 30 June 1861.  (This was probably to allow the survivors of the lost men to collect 6 months of their pay as compensation.)Literary reemergence[edit]In 1863, when Edward Everett Hale wrote the patriotic short story The Man Without a Country, the announcement of the death of the exiled Philip Nolan while at sea is said to have been while he was aboard the USS Levant on 11 May 1863.  In reality, the ship was last heard from in September 1860.References[edit]^ Hague, James D. (December 1904). "A doubtful island of the Pacific". National Geographic. XV: 478–489.

The front side of the puzzle shows, in the initial state, three separate, rainbow-coloured rings; the back side consists of a scrambled picture of three interconnected rings. The goal of the game is to fold the puzzle into a heart-like shape and unscramble the picture on the back side, thus interconnecting the rings.Numerous ways to accomplish this exist, and experienced players can transform the puzzle from its initial into the solved state in less than 2 seconds.[1] Other challenges for Rubik's Magic include reproducing given shapes (which are often three-dimensional), sometimes with certain tiles required to be in certain positions and/or orientations.Contents1 History2 Details3 Analysis4 Records5 Rubik's Magic: Master Edition6 See also7 References8 External linksHistory[edit]Rubik's Magic was first manufactured by Matchbox in 1986. Professor Rubik holds both a Hungarian patent (HU 1211/85, issued 19 March 1985) and a US patent (US 4,685,680, issued 11 August 1987) on the mechanism of Rubik's Magic. In 1987, Rubik's Magic: Master Edition was published by Matchbox; it consisted of 12 silver tiles arranged in a 2 × 6 rectangle, showing 5 interlinked rings that had to be unlinked by transforming the puzzle into a shape reminiscent of a W. Around the same time, Matchbox also produced Rubik's Magic Create the Cube,[2] a "Level Two" version of Rubik's Magic, in which the puzzle is solved when folded into a cube with a base of two tiles, and the tile colors match at the corners of the cube.[3] It did not have as wide a release, and is rare to find.In 1996, the original version of Rubik's Magic was re-released by Oddzon, this time with yellow rings on a red background; other versions (for example, a variant of the original with silver tiles instead of black ones) were also produced, and there also was a strategy game based on Rubik's Magic. An unlicensed 2 × 8 version was also produced, with spheres printed on its tiles instead of rings. Custom versions as large as 2 × 12 have been built using kits available from Oddzon.Details[edit] A Rubik's Magic chainIt can be seen that the total number of 2 × 4 rectangles that can possibly be created using Rubik's Magic is only thirty-two; these can be created from eight distinct chains. The easiest way to classify chains is by the means of the middle tile of the puzzle's finished form (the only tile that has segments of all three rings) and the tile next to it featuring a yellow/orange ring segment (the indicator tile).Every chain either has the middle tile on the outside (O) or the inside (I) of the chain; if it is arranged so that the indicator tile is to the right of the middle tile, then the position of the ring segment on the indicator tile can either be the upper left (UL), upper right (UR), lower left (LL), or lower right (LR) corner. The position and orientation of the remaining tiles are then determined by the middle and indicator tiles, and eight distinct chains (OUL to ILR) are obtained, although the naming convention is not standardized.Similarly, the 2 × 4 rectangle forms of them can be categorized. Each of these forms has exactly one chain associated with it, and each chain yields four different rectangle forms, depending on the position of the edge where it is folded with regard to the middle tile. By concatenating one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, or 3 to the chain's name, depending on whether the number of tiles to the right of the middle tile before the folding edge, a categorization of the rectangle forms is obtained. The starting position, for example, is rectangle form OUR2.The cube now is rainbow and has silver rings. A game rule for this one is you can match the silver rings and color squares, which can make it more complicated.A similar classification can also be obtained for the heart-shaped forms of the puzzle, of which 64 exist.Analysis[edit]One question when analyzing Rubik's Magic concerns its state space: What is the set of configurations that can be reached from the initial state? This question is harder to answer than for Rubik's Cube, because the set of operations on Rubik's Magic does not form a mathematical group.The basic operation (move) consists of transferring a hinge between two tiles T1 and T2, from one pair of edges (E11 of T1 and E21 on T2) to another pair E12 and E22.Here, edges E11 and E12 are adjacent on tile T1,and so are edges E21 and E22 on tile T2 but in opposite order. See the figure below for an example, where E11 is the East edge of the yellow tile, E21 is the West edge of the red tile, and both E21 and E22 are the North edges. A basic move, transferring a hinge between two tiles to another pair of edgesIn order to carry out such a move, the hinge being moved cannot cross another hinge. Thus, the two hinges on a tile can take up one of five relative positions (see figure below). The positions are encoded as a number in the range from -2 to +2, called the wrap. The difference between wrap -2 and wrap +2 is the order of the neighboring tiles (which one is on top). The total wrap of a configuration is calculated as the alternating sum of the wraps of the individual tiles in the chain.The total wrap is invariant under a move. Thus, one can calculate the number of theoretically possible shapes of the chain (disregarding the patterns on the individual tiles) as 1351.[4] All possible relative positions of the two hinges on a single tile; the number below the tile is the amount of wrapFurthermore, the other tiles in the chain will have to move through space appropriately to allow the folding and unfolding needed to carry out a move. This limits the practically reachable number of configurations further. That number also depends on how much stretching of the wires you tolerate.Records[edit]The world record for a single solve of the Magic is 0.69 seconds, set by Yuxuan Wang. Yuxuan Wang also holds the record for an average of five solves - 0.76 seconds set at the Beijing Summer Open 2011 competition.[5] Due to the World Cube Association no longer recognizing Rubik's Magic as an official event as of 2012, Yuxuan Wang holds the permanent world record for this puzzle.Rubik's Magic: Master Edition[edit] Rubik's Magic: Master Edition Rubik's Magic: Master Edition in solved stateRubik's Magic: Master Edition (most commonly known as Master Magic) was manufactured by Matchbox in 1987. It is a modification from the Rubik's Magic, with 12 tiles instead of the original's 8. The puzzle has 12 panels interconnected with nylon wires in a 2 × 6 rectangular shape, measuring approximately 4.25 inches (10.5 cm) by 13 inches (32 cm). The goal of the game is the same as for Rubik's Magic, which is to fold the puzzle from a 2 × 6 rectangular shape into a W-like shape with a certain tile arrangement. Initially, the front side shows a set of 5 linked rings. Once solved, the puzzle takes the shape of the letter W, and shows 5 unlinked rings on the back side of the previous initial state.[6]As a puzzle, the Master Edition is actually simpler than the original Rubik's Magic. With more hinges, the player can work on one part, mostly ignoring the other parts. The minimal solution involves 16 quarter-turn moves.[7] There are multiple solutions.[6] The puzzle was an official World Cube Association (WCA) event from 2003-2012.[8]See also[edit]Pocket CubeRubik's CubeRubik's RevengeProfessor's CubeV-Cube 6V-Cube 7V-Cube 8Combination puzzlesMechanical puzzlesJacob's ladder (toy)References[edit]^ Official World Rankings^ Rubik's Create The Cube at TwistyPuzzles.com, retrieved May 2, 2007^ Rubik's Magic: Create the Cube at Jaap's Puzzle Page, retrieved May 2, 2007^ Verhoeff, Tom (1987).

He is the current reserve driver for Williams Racing in Formula One.Born in London to a Scottish father and South Korean mother,[3] Aitken began his career in karting at Buckmore Park, aged 7. He made the transition to cars when he competed in the Intersteps Championship with Fortec Motorsport, with whom he then went on to race with in the Formula Renault BARC Winter Series, Formula Renault NEC and Formula Renault Eurocup.After winning the Formula Renault Eurocup in 2015, Aitken was signed up for the Renault young driver academy, with which he remained until 2019. After competing in the GP3 Series in 2016 and 2017 he progressed to Formula 2 for 2018. He has been Williams F1's reserve driver since 2020, and raced for the team at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix, replacing George Russell, who, in turn, replaced Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes for the event.Contents1 Career1.1 Karting1.2 Formula Renault1.3 Pro Mazda Championship1.4 GP3 Series1.4.1 20161.4.2 20171.5 Formula 21.5.1 20181.5.2 20191.5.3 20201.5.4 20211.6 GT World Challenge Europe1.7 Formula One1.7.1 Williams (2020–present)1.8 ADAC GT Masters1.9 European Le Mans1.10 24 Hours of Le Mans2 Karting record2.1 Karting career summary3 Racing record3.1 Racing career summary3.2 American open-wheel racing results3.2.1 Pro Mazda Championship3.3 Complete GP3 Series results3.4 Complete Formula V8 3.5 Series results3.5 Complete FIA Formula 2 Championship results3.6 Complete Formula One results3.7 Complete GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup results3.8 Complete GT World Challenge Europe Sprint Cup results3.9 Complete ADAC GT Masters results3.10 Complete European Le Mans Series results3.11 Complete 24 Hours of Le Mans results4 References5 External linksCareer[edit]Karting[edit]Aitken started his karting career at Buckmore Park Kart Circuit in Kent. He competed in the 2010 Super 1 National Kart Championships in the Rotax Mini Max class, finishing third behind champion and future Formula 2 teammate George Russell.Formula Renault[edit]Aitken progressed into single-seater car racing in 2012, competing in the four races of the 2012 Formula Renault BARC Winter Series. He won the final race at Rockingham Motor Speedway and finished second in the standings behind Fortec Motorsport teammate Seb Morris. He also competed for Fortec in the 2012 Dunlop InterSteps Championship, taking two wins to finish third in the championship behind future GP3 Series competitor Matt Parry.In 2013 Aitken competed in the Formula Renault 2.0 Northern European Cup, in a field which included future Formula One drivers Esteban Ocon and Alex Albon. He finished second in the championship, again losing out to Fortec teammate Parry. Aitken also appeared as a guest driver in three rounds of the main Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 series, recording a best finish of ninth place at the Red Bull Ring.Aitken entered his first full season of Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0 in 2014 with Fortec.[4] He won one race at the Hungaroring and finished on the podium three further times to end the season seventh in the championship. During the first half of the campaign, he had to finish his A-Level qualifications while attending Westminster School. He also made guest appearances in the Formula Renault 2.0 Alps series, with best finishes of fourth place at the Imola Circuit.For 2015, Aitken moved to Koiranen GP in Formula Renault 2.0, contesting both the Eurocup and Alps series. He won both titles at the final rounds at the Circuito de Jerez, one week apart. He took nine race wins in total, finishing ahead of Louis Delétraz in the Eurocup and Jake Hughes in the Alps series.[5]Pro Mazda Championship[edit]Aitken made his first appearance in American open-wheel racing in 2014, competing in one round of the Pro Mazda Championship (now the Indy Pro 2000 Championship) at the Sonoma Raceway with a best finish of fourth place. In 2015 he took part in the Pro Mazda Winterfest for Team Pelfrey. He won three of the five races to win the championship ahead of future IndyCar driver Dalton Kellett and future Williams Formula One teammate Nicholas Latifi.GP3 Series[edit]2016[edit]In January 2016, Aitken stepped up to the GP3 Series with Arden International. In his maiden season, he claimed a victory at Spa-Francorchamps and six additional podiums to finish fifth in the overall standings, one point behind teammate Jake Dennis. In that year, Aitken also made brief appearances in the Euroformula Open and Formula V8 3.5 series, claiming two wins and two pole positions in four races in Euroformula Open and a pole position in Formula V8 3.5.2017[edit]In February 2017, it was announced that Aitken would remain in the GP3 Series, switching to reigning team champions ART Grand Prix. He took one race win at the Hungaroring and five further podium finishes, finishing second in the championship with 141 points, behind champion and former karting rival George Russell on 220 points.Formula 2[edit]2018[edit] Aitken at the 2018 Spielberg Formula 2 roundIn January 2018, ART Grand Prix announced Aitken would join their Formula 2 team for the 2018 FIA Formula 2 Championship, again partnering Russell.[6] He took his first podium finish with second place in the Baku feature race, and later took his first victory in the Barcelona sprint race.[7] He finished 11th in the championship with 63 points, whilst Russell claimed the title with 287 points.2019[edit] Aitken with Campos Racing in 2019For the 2019 season Aitken moved to Campos Racing, initially partnering Dorian Boccolacci and later Arjun Maini and Marino Sato.[8] Aitken took his first win of the season, and Campos Racing's first win in Formula 2, at the Baku feature race. He also won his home sprint race at Silverstone, after overtaking Louis Delétraz on lap 17. Aitken also won the Monza sprint race after defending from the MP Motorsport car of Jordan King. King criticised Aitken's defensive driving as he claimed after the race that Aitken was weaving down the straight. Aitken finished fifth in the standings, scoring 159 of Campos' 189 points and helping them to finish fifth in the teams' championship.2020[edit]Aitken remained at Campos for 2020, partnering Guilherme Samaia. Aitken took a double-podium finish at the second Silverstone round, finishing third in both the feature race and sprint race. He was involved in a high-speed collision with Luca Ghiotto on lap seven of the sprint race at Sochi Autodrom. Both drivers were uninjured, but damage to the barriers caused the race to be red-flagged and not restarted.[9] Aitken missed the final round at the Bahrain International Circuit to race in Formula One, and was replaced by Ralph Boschung. Aitken finished 14th in the standings, scoring all of Campos' 48 points.2021[edit]Aitken left Campos and the Formula 2 series after 2020, however he returned during the 2021 season with HWA Racelab as a replacement for Matteo Nannini, who withdrew from the championship after the first round.[10] He was initially signed for the second and third rounds in Monaco and Baku respectively and was later retained for the fourth round at Silverstone.[11] He recorded a best finish of ninth place in the second Monaco sprint race, but failed to score points over the three rounds.GT World Challenge Europe[edit]After leaving Campos in Formula 2, Aitken switched to sports car racing and joined the GT World Challenge Europe. He competes in both the Endurance and Sprint cups, driving a Lamborghini Huracán GT3 Evo for Emil Frey Racing alongside Konsta Lappalainen. His first race was the 3 Hours of Monza, for which Aitken and his teammates qualified 14th. However, Aitken did not drive in the race as the car was retired following damage from a puncture.[12]In July 2021 during the Spa 24 Hours event, Aitken was involved in a crash along with 3 other drivers. He crashed into the barrier after Raidillon, bounced back onto the track and came to a stop before being hit from behind by another driver which caused two further cars to become entangled in the accident. Aitken was taken to hospital where he stayed overnight.[13] His injuries were described as non life-threatening though serious and it was later revealed that he had sustained "a broken collarbone, a fractured vertebra ... and a very small lung contusion".[14][15]For the 2022 season, Aitken is racing exclusively in the endurance rounds of the championship, paring up with Mirko Bortolotti and Albert Costa in the same Emil Frey Racing Lamborghini. He finished 13th and 6th in the first two races, held in Imola and Paul Ricard respectively. In the 24 Hours of Spa, after a crash for Costa, Aitken failed to finish the race.Formula One[edit]In February 2016, Aitken was one of four drivers confirmed to join the young driver program of Renault F1. In September 2017, Aitken sampled Formula One machinery for the first time, testing the Lotus E20 at Jerez. In February 2018, Aitken was appointed as third and reserve driver for Renault.[16][17] Aitken continued as test driver for Renault in 2019, taking part in the young drivers' test at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya.[18]Williams (2020–present)[edit]For the 2020 season Aitken joined the Williams Driver Academy alongside Formula 2 rivals Dan Ticktum and Roy Nissany, and W Series and Extreme E driver Jamie Chadwick. Aitken was also appointed Williams' reserve driver.[19] He drove in the first practice session (FP1) of the 2020 Styrian Grand Prix for the team.[20]Aitken made his Formula One debut as a race driver with Williams at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix as a replacement for George Russell, who was promoted to Mercedes following Lewis Hamilton's positive coronavirus test.[21] Aitken stated before the event he had been "ready since Melbourne [March]" for such an opportunity.[22] He chose to race with the car number 89, in reference to a number he previously used in karting.[21] He qualified for the race in 18th place, within a tenth of a second of teammate and regular driver Nicholas Latifi.[23][24] On lap 61 of 87, 15th-placed Aitken spun at the final corner, colliding with a barrier and breaking off his front wing. He returned to the pits for a replacement and was able to continue the race, eventually finishing 16th. He later remarked that he had mixed feelings about the race, stating "I think we were doing a really good job up until my little incident. I can only apologise to the whole team", but that there were "a lot of positives to take from the weekend".[25]Aitken performed Thursday media duties with Williams ahead of the next race in Abu Dhabi but ultimately did not drive the car, as Russell returned to the team prior to FP1 when Hamilton was passed fit to return to Mercedes.[26]In March 2021, Williams announced that Aitken would continue to be their reserve driver for the 2021 season.[27] He took part in FP1 at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, replacing Russell for the session.[28]Aitken retained his reserve driver role with Williams for the 2022 season.[29]ADAC GT Masters[edit]In 2022 Aitken moved to the ADAC GT Masters, racing with Albert Costa for Emil Frey Racing.[30]European Le Mans[edit]As of 2022, Aitken competes in the LMP2 Pro-Am class for Racing Team Turkey alongside Charlie Eastwood and Salih Yoluç. After round two, they lead the Pro-Am championship standings.24 Hours of Le Mans[edit]Aikten before the start of the 2022 edition (left) and his car, the No. 47 Algarve Pro Racing Oreca 07 (right).Aitken made his 24 Hours of Le Mans in the 2022 edition, competing for Algarve Pro Racing alongside Sophia Flörsch and John Falb. The trio finished 25th overall, 20th in the LMP2 class and 5th in the Pro-Am sub class.Karting record[edit]Karting career summary[edit]SeasonSeriesTeamPosition2006Kartmasters British Grand Prix — WTP Cadet12thBayford Kart Club Summer Sprint Championship — Honda Cadet3rdSuper 1 National Championship — Comer Cadet4th2008Kartmasters British Grand Prix — Rotax Mini Max14thBuckmore Park Summer Championship — MinimaxThe Kart Shop2nd2009Buckmore Park Summer Championship — MinimaxThe Kart Shop1stSuper One Series ABkC Championship — MiniMax13th2010Shenington Kart Club — Rotax Mini Max9thRotax Max Euro Challenge — Junior2ndRotax Max Challenge Grand Finals — Junior16thSuper 1 National Championship — Rotax Mini Max3rd2011Trent Valley Kart Club — Senior Rotax24thTrent Valley Kart Club — Junior Rotax46thShenington Kart Club — Rotax Mini Max6thBNL Karting Series — Rotax Max Junior2nd2012Rotax Max Euro Challenge — Senior35thRacing record[edit]Racing career summary[edit]SeasonSeriesTeamRacesWinsPolesF/LapsPodiumsPointsPosition2012Intersteps ChampionshipFortec Motorsports23223134903rd2013Formula Renault 2.0 NECFortec Motorsports1601152302ndEurocup Formula Renault 2.0200000NC†Manor MP Motorsport400002014Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0Fortec Motorsports141104867thFormula Renault 2.0 Alps800100NC†Pro Mazda ChampionshipTeam Pelfrey200003120th2015Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0Koiranen GP1754362061stFormula Renault 2.0 Alps1543372421stPro Mazda WinterfestTeam Pelfrey531241671st2016GP3 SeriesArden International1810271485thEuroformula Open ChampionshipRP Motorsport42213718thSpanish Formula 3 Championship21111277thFormula V8 3.5 Series401001415th2017GP3 SeriesART Grand Prix1512261412nd2018FIA Formula 2 Championship2310026311thFormula OneRenault Sport F1 TeamTest driver2019FIA Formula 2 ChampionshipCampos Racing2230271595thFormula OneRenault F1 TeamTest driver2020FIA Formula 2 ChampionshipCampos Racing2200124814thFormula OneWilliams Racing10000022nd2021FIA Formula 2 ChampionshipHWA Racelab90000023rdGT World Challenge Europe Sprint CupEmil Frey Racing6001017.519thGT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup40000824thFormula OneWilliams RacingReserve driver2022ADAC GT MastersEmil Frey Racing1011231113rd*GT World Challenge Europe Endurance Cup400101716th*Intercontinental GT Challenge100000NC*European Le Mans SeriesRacing Team Turkey40000217th*24 Hours of Le Mans -

Originally, a total of 27 ships were planned, but due to programme delays and overruns, only six were eventually ordered. Their construction began in the early 2000s, and by 2009, all six were in active service. The six vessels are named after Malaysian states.Contents1 Classification2 Development3 Progress delay4 Characteristics5 Improved design and next order6 Major operation7 Ships of the class8 Gallery9 ReferencesClassification[edit]While their size and tonnage implies the Kedah-class ships to be corvettes, they are classified as offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) by the Royal Malaysian Navy, a category more common with law enforcement or coast guard vessels, not naval warships. This is rooted in the fact that the Kedah class was delivered in a condition named for but not with, meaning that certain weapon systems were not included in the original purchase, but all provisions to install and use them, including sensors and electronics, are already present in the ships. The weapons themselves can be easily "plugged in" with little delay as soon as the Royal Malaysian Navy has purchased them. These purchases however have not yet been made. Currently, the Kedah-class vessels are armed with guns only (76 mm gun on the bow, 30 mm gun on the aft), making them quite lightly armed and fairly vulnerable for naval ships of their size, thus justifying their listing as OPVs rather than proper corvettes.[1]Development[edit]In the 1990s, the Royal Malaysian Navy identified the need to replace their ageing patrol boats. These 31 m long vessels built by Vosper Ltd with a displacement of 96 tons had been in service since the 1960s.[2] After receiving government approval, the Royal Malaysian Navy ran a competition for the design in 1996, planning to purchase 27 vessels over 15 years. The specifications aimed for a design with a displacement of 1,300 tons and an overall length of 80 m. It was already noted at that time that this resembled full-fledged corvettes rather than patrol vessels, but the eventual winning bid would turn out to be even larger.[3] The Australian bid proposed a Joint Patrol Vessel, to be designed by Australian Transfield Shipbuilding and subsequently purchased by the Royal Malaysian Navy as well as the Royal Australian Navy.[4] Other contenders were the German Naval Group consortium as well as British shipyards Vosper Thornycroft and Yarrow Shipbuilders.In October 1997, the German Naval Group consortium, headed by Blohm + Voss, was declared the winner with their design based on the modular MEKO family of warships, and a contract for six vessels was signed by the Royal Malaysian Navy and PSC-Naval Dockyard on 5 September 1998, with a unit cost of 270 million dollar per vessel.Progress delay[edit]Main article: PSC-Naval Dockyard § Financial and Delivery ProblemsThe shipbuilding has been plagued by financial and technical problems and delays. The first setback occurred when the first hull completed by PSC-Naval Dockyard failed to pass pre-delivery sea trials due to technical problems and quality issues. The crisis continued until the Malaysian government replaced the management team.[5] The programme resumed, but the scandal discouraged the Malaysian Government from further investments.In June 2006, after a total of 18 months of delays, the Royal Malaysian Navy commissioned KD Kedah, followed by a second hull, KD Pahang in August of the same year, and a third hull, KD Perak on 12 November 2007. By July 2009, six vessels had been launched.Characteristics[edit]The Kedah class is based on the MEKO 100 corvette. It is designed to have low radar detectability, low noise, low heat dissipation, and have an economical cruising speed. The main radar, TRS-3D/16-ES is a fully coherent multi-mode phased array C-band radar capable of fully automatic detection, track initiation, and classification of various types of targets. It is capable to track 400 air and surface targets with the detection range up to 200 km and the corresponding update times between 1 and 6 seconds.[6] An advanced control system known as Integrated Platform Management System (IPMS) is used to monitor and control the platform machinery of the ships, including propulsion, electrical, damage control, and auxiliary machinery and systems.Due to the small ship complement, the design relies on a high degree of automation for improved operational effectiveness and survivability of the ships. The design uses intelligent electronics and sensors interconnected by data buses. This enables monitoring and control of machinery from several shipboard locations. The ship has redundant systems to improve survivability.All Kedah-class vessels are fitted for but not with the RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile (RAM) surface-to-air missile and the Exocet MM40 Block 2 anti-ship missile. It also can fitted with BrahMos cruise missile if it was purchased.[7] Once the weapons themselves were purchased, it would reportedly take only one day for them to be installed, after which they could be immediately used with full functionality.[8]Improved design and next order[edit]In Defence Services Asia 2018 (DSA 2018) BHIC unveiled the new improved design of the Kedah-class to fulfill the Royal Malaysian Navy modernization program, 15 to 5 program. Under this program 12 more Kedah-class will be order to complement the six existing Kedah-class makes the total of 18 Kedah-class will be in service with Royal Malaysian Navy. The design incorporated improvement in stealth design where the ships will have low radar cross section then before. This new design also modular where the end user can choose whether to armed this ships with guns only or to fitted for but not with missiles and torpedo.[9]Major operation[edit]KD Pahang involved in Anti-piracy measures in Somalia in 2008.[10]KD Perak involved in naval blockade in 2013 Lahad Datu standoff.Ships of the class[edit]All ships of the class were named after states in Peninsular Malaysia.PennantNameBuildersLaid downLaunchedCommissionedDivision/SquadronF171KD KedahBlohm + Voss13 November 200121 March 20035 June 200617th PV SquadronF172KD PahangHDW21 December 20012 October 20033 August 200617th PV SquadronF173KD PerakBoustead Heavy Industries Corporation (BHIC)March 200212 November 20073 June 200917th PV SquadronF174KD TerengganuBoustead Heavy Industries Corporation (BHIC)August 20046 December 20078 December 200917th PV SquadronF175KD KelantanBoustead Heavy Industries Corporation (BHIC)July 200524 November 20088 May 201017th PV SquadronF176KD SelangorBoustead Heavy Industries Corporation (BHIC)July 200623 July 200928 December 201017th PV SquadronGallery[edit]KD Kelantan (fore) with USS Carl Vinson and Kasturi-class corvette KD Lekir.KD Terengganu on the seas.KD Kelantan with Super Lynx ASW helicopter.KD Kelantan on the seas.KD Perak at Boustead Naval Shipyard before the handing over to the Royal Malaysian Navy.KD Selangor at Sandakan, Sabah.References[edit]Wikimedia Commons has media related to Kedah class offshore patrol vessels.^ Hooten, Ted (1 August 2013): Corvettes and OPVs: Offshore Investments Archived 2015-01-12 at the Wayback Machine.

D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, and developed an obsession with both the character and the author.[4][5]Career[edit]Clarkson began his journalism career in 1967 as a freelance newspaper writer.[6] He moved to Niagara Falls, Ontario, when his freelancing career fell apart, and collected welfare for several months before getting a job at the Niagara Falls Review.[6][7]  In 1978, his depression led him to Cornish, New Hampshire, to try to meet his favorite author, J. D. Salinger, who had famously retreated from public life after giving his last interview in 1953.[7][5] He had a brief conversation with an uncooperative Salinger at the base of his driveway, then returned unannounced a year later to speak some more with Salinger in his home.[7] Clarkson wrote an article[7] about his two visits that he sold to The New York Times Syndicate for $1,500.[4] The article was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.[1]Clarkson spent the 1980s working at the St. Catharines Standard. In 1985, he worked with Kevin Cavanagh, Doug Herod, and Kevin McMahon on a series of stories about the mass arrest of 32 men charged for sex offenses committed in a St. Catharines shopping mall washroom leading to one man committing suicide.[8] The series led to changes in the city's police procedures for handling such offenses.[8] The following year, the stories earned the four reporters the inaugural Centre for Investigative Journalism Award for excellence in investigative journalism.[8]Clarkson's work with fellow reporter John Nicol earned the two an honorable mention from the National Newspaper Awards and two awards from the Western Ontario Newspaper Awards.[9][10] In 1989, Clarkson received the 1988 National Newspaper Award for Sports Writing for a feature article about hockey legend Hap Emms.[11] It was the Standard's first National Newspaper Award.[11] After leaving the newspaper, Clarkson received the 1990 Western Ontario Newspaper Award for News Feature for an article published the previous year in the Standard on the stress suffered by police who investigate their colleagues, and he was also runner-up in the Humor Writing and Beat Coverage categories.[12]In 1990, Clarkson moved to the Calgary Herald.[12] He received an honorable mention in 1991 from the Western Fairs Association for a behind-the-scenes article about the Calgary Stampede.[13] Articles about the AIDS-related deaths of 40 male figure skaters and coaches earned Clarkson the 1992 National Newspaper Award for Sports Writing.[14]Clarkson and Sharon Adams wrote a series of several articles published in the spring of 1994 called "Coping with Change" about how the people of Calgary, Alberta, were coping with a sluggish economy.[15] The series earned the two reporters the 1995 Media Awards for Excellence in Health Reporting from the Canadian Nurses Association.[16]Also in 1994, Clarkson and Ron Collins wrote a series of stories revealing how the health care system was destroying the lives of native Canadians by making it easy for them to abuse prescription drugs.[17][18] The series led the Alberta College of Physicians and Surgeons to charge Calgary physician Dr. Dionisio David with improperly prescribing drugs.[18][19] David resigned to avoid the charges.[19]  The series was a finalist for both the (U.S.) National Institute of Health Care Management Award for International Health-care Reporting and the 1995 Canadian Association of Journalists award in the open newspaper category.[18][20]Clarkson moved to the Toronto Star in 1995.[21] He took a buyout and retired from the newspaper in 2004.[6]After officially retiring, Clarkson spent his time writing books and speaking on mental health.[22] In 2020, he wrote and produced a documentary on suicides at Niagara Falls that focused on the death of his friend and poet, Robert Billings.[2][23]Personal life[edit]Clarkson and his wife Jennifer married in 1974.[24]  They have two children.[24]In addition to chronic depression, Clarkson also suffered from occasional vasovagal attacks, a common form of fainting spells.[25]During the 1980s, Clarkson participated in rescue missions for people who went over Niagara Falls.[3][23]Honors[edit]1986 Centre for Investigative Journalism Award for best piece of investigative reporting in print, shared with Kevin Cavanagh, Doug

Mussey studied at Dartmouth College and then learned medicine under Nathan Smith. He began the practice of medicine in Essex County, Massachusetts. However, he then went to the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine where he did further medical studies, graduating M.D. in 1809.[2][3] Among his professors at the University of Pennsylvania was Benjamin Rush. Mussey was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1811.[4]He then was a professor at the medical school at Dartmouth College and also at Middlebury College, as well as serving as a medical lecturer at other institutions. Mussey is credited as the first surgeon to tie both carotid arteries in 1829.[5][6] He lectured on anatomy and surgery at Bowdoin College (1831-1835) and Fairfield Academy (1836-1838).[2] He was professor of surgery at the Medical College of Ohio (1838-1852) and was chair of surgery at Miami Medical College in Cincinnati (1852-1857).[2]Mussey was an advocate of the temperance movement.[7] In 1828, a temperance society was founded at Dartmouth. In 1850 he served as president of the American Medical Association.[2] Health: Its Friends and Foes, 1862He was awarded an LL.D from Dartmouth in 1854 and an honorary A.

Mussey who both followed their father into the medical profession. Charles F. Mussey became a Presbyterian minister. Mussey's daughter Maria married Lyman Mason, and his daughter Catharine married Shattuck Hartwell.Vegetarianism[edit]Mussey was a vegetarian who abstained from alcohol and tobacco.[2][10] In 1832, Mussey "gave up the eating of flesh as an experiment", he did not eat the flesh of land animals for the rest of his life but occasionally consumed fish in 1850.[11] He was a frequent contributor to William Alcott's vegetarian journal Library of Health.[12] His 1862 book Health: Its Friends and Foes included chapters on vegetarianism and on the dangers of tobacco.[13] It was positively reviewed in the Cincinnati Lancet and Observer and The New England Journal of Medicine.[14][15]Mussey was a founding member and vice-president of the American Vegetarian Society in the 1850s.[16]Selected publications[edit]Health: Its Friends and Foes (1862)What Shall I Drink?

Launched aboard a Safir-B carrier rocket, it was successfully placed into a low Earth orbit at an altitude of 236 by 299 kilometres (147 by 186 mi), inclined at 55.7 degrees. It made approximately fifteen orbits per day.[citation needed]Rasad-1 was launched on the maiden flight of the Safir-B rocket, designated Safir-B1, from a launch site in Semnan Province, Iran. The launch occurred at approximately 09:14 UTC on 15 June 2011 with the spacecraft reaching orbit several minutes later.The satellite had a mass of 15.3 kilograms (34 lb) and returned images with a resolution of 150 metres (490 ft).[citation needed] It was equipped with solar panels to generate power. The satellite decayed from orbit three weeks after launch, on 6 July 2011.[4][5]Rasad 1 TelemetryAFSK Telemetry recorded from the Rasad 1 satellite on 465Mhz.Problems playing this file?

Ltd. or JHICC is a Chinese state-owned DRAM manufacturer based in Fujian, China. It is part of the Made in China 2025 program,[1] a component of China's strategy to gain self sufficiency in the semiconductor industry, and had claimed to be a national leader in China's tech industry.[2]Contents1 Founding and purpose2 Dispute with Micron3 U.S. government sanctions and indictment4 ReferencesFounding and purpose[edit]Fujian Jinhua is a Chinese state-owned company, founded in February 2016, with an investment of US$5.6 billion from the Chinese national government and Fujian Province government.[3] Its management, as reported by China Daily, said that its goal is to "fill the gap in the domestic market by producing integrated circuit products for mobile phone manufacturers in the country."[4] It was part of the Chinese government's plan to reach 70% self-sufficiency in semiconductors by the year 2025,[3] and not be reliant on "massive imports of integrated circuits and chips" from countries like South Korea.[4]Fujian Jinhua was to concentrate on DRAM development, along with Changxin Memory Technologies, previously known as Innotron.[3] Fujian Jinhua planned to develop its production capacity for DRAM chips in servers, in cooperation with Taiwan-based United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC).[3] Fujian Jinhua's production facility is in Jinjiang, Fujian.[4] It was expected to be China's largest single integrated circuit manufacturing facility and have its first phase completed in September 2018. Fujian Jinhua planned to produce products worth $6 billion each year.[4]Along with other chip startups like Yangtze Memory Technologies Co. and Changxin, Fujian Jinhua was seen as crucial for China's self-sufficiency in the semiconductor industry.[5]Dispute with Micron[edit]Micron Technology, a U.S. memory chip maker, accused Fujian Jinhua and UMC of stealing Micron chip designs.[1] It accused UMC of hiring Micron employees, stealing its trade secrets, and transferring them to Fujian Jinhua.[6] Fujian Jinhua countersued in China, successfully convincing a Chinese court to ban some of Micron's chips in China.[1]U.S. government sanctions and indictment[edit]In October 2018, the U.S. placed Fujian Jinhua on the Bureau of Industry and Security's Entity List, meaning that it cannot buy goods with components, software or technology from American firms.[2] The move took place in the midst of the U.S.-China Trade War. The Trump administration alleged that Fujian Jinhua could flood the market with cheap chips and bankrupt American firms that supply the U.S. military, and was therefore a national security threat.[1] China asserted that the move violated WTO rules on trade and was aimed at protecting a U.S. monopoly.[2] Trade experts said that the use of the entities list to protect the economic viability of a U.S. firm, rather than to sanction another country, was unprecedented.[1]Then, in November 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice announced an indictment against Fujian Jinhua and Taiwanese company UMC, alleging that they conspired to steal intellectual property from Micron.[2] The indictment was originally filed in September 2018.[2] The U.S. government sees the case of Fujian Jinhua as part of a broader pattern of IP theft. The firm plead not guilty in January 2019.[2] After U.S. sanctions, UMC said it suspended its partnership with Jinhua, and by early 2019, 200 of 300 UMC engineers sent to Fujian Jinhua returned to Taiwan.[5] Media reports suggested that Fujian Jinhua ceased production in March 2019.[5]In October 2020, UMC pleaded guilty to one count of receiving and possessing a stolen trade-secret, and agreed to pay a US$60 million fine, in exchange for co-operating against Fujian Jinhua.[7][8]References[edit]^ a b c d e Lawder, David (2018-10-30).

For the poem by Jibanananda Das, see Campe (poem). For the lexicographer, see Joachim Heinrich Campe.In Greek mythology, Campe  or Kampe (Greek: Κάμπη) was a female monster. She was the guard, in Tartarus, of the Cyclopes and Hundred-Handers, whom Uranus had imprisoned there. When it was prophesied to Zeus that he would be victorious in the Titanomachy—the great war against the Titans—with the help of Campe's prisoners, he killed Campe, freeing the Cyclopes and Hundred-Handers, who then helped Zeus defeat Cronus.[1]Contents1 Name2 Sources3 Notes4 ReferencesName[edit]The name given in Greek texts is Κάμπη, with an accent on the first syllable. As a common noun κάμπη is the Greek word for caterpillar or silkworm. It is probably related to the homophone καμπή (with the accent on the second syllable) whose first meaning is the winding of a river, and came to mean, more generally, any kind of bend, or curve.[2]Sources[edit]We first hear of the imprisonment of the Cyclopes and Hundred-Handers, and their subsequent release by Zeus, in Hesiod's Theogony.[3] However Hesiod makes no mention of Campe, or any guard for the prisoners. These events were probably also told in the lost epic poem the Titanomachy,[4] upon which the mythographer Apollodorus perhaps based his account of the war.[5] According to Apollodorus:Zeus waged the war against Cronus and the Titans. They fought for ten years, and Earth prophesied victory to Zeus if he should have as allies those who had been hurled down to Tartarus. So he slew their jailoress Campe, and loosed their bonds.[6]Diodorus Siculus says that the god Dionysus, while camped beside the Libyan city of Zabirna, encountered and killed "an earth-born monster called Campê" that was terrorizing the city, killing many of its residents.[7]Neither Apollodorus nor Diodorus provide any description of Campe; however, the Greek poet Nonnus provides an elaborately detailed one. According to Nonnus, Zeus, with his thunderbolt, destroyed:highheaded Campe ... for all the many crooked shapes of her whole body. A thousand crawlers from her viperish feet, spitting poison afar, were fanning Enyo to a flame, a mass of misshapen coils. Round her neck flowered fifty various heads of wild beasts : some roared with lion's heads like the grim face of the riddling Sphinx; others were spluttering foam from the tusks of wild boars; her countenance was the very image of Scylla with a marshalled regiment of thronging dog's heads. Doubleshaped, she appeared a woman to the middle of her body, with clusters of poison-spitting serpents for hair. Her giant form, from the chest to the parting-point of the thighs, was covered all over with a bastard shape of hard sea-monsters' scales. The claws of her wide-scattering hands were curved like a crooktalon sickle. From her neck over her terrible shoulders, with tail raised high over her throat, a scorpion with an icy sting sharp-whetted crawled and coiled upon itself. Such was manifoldshaped Campe as she rose writhing, and flew roaming about earth and air and briny deep, and flapping a couple of dusky wings, rousing tempests and arming gales, that blackwinged nymphe of Tartaros: from her eyelids a flickering flame belched out far-travelling sparks. Yet heavenly Zeus ... killed that great monster, and conquered the snaky Enyo Cronos.[8]Thus for Nonnus, Campe is woman-like from the upper torso and above, with the scales of a sea-monster from the chest down, with several snaky appendages, along with the parts of several other animals protruding from her body.[9] His description of Campe is similar to Hesiod's description of the monster Typhon (Theogony 820 ff.).[10] Joseph Eddy Fontenrose says that for Nonnus, Campe "was a female counterpart of his Typhon ... That is, she was Echidna under a different name, as Nonnus indicates, calling her Echidnaean Enyo, identifying her snaky legs with echidnas, and likening her to Sphinx and Skylla".[11]Notes[edit]^ Grimal, p. 87 s.v.

His signature on-stage style incorporated strenuous dance moves similar to those of Jackie Wilson.  He was born in Kalihi, Hawaii on the island of Oahu.Contents1 Biography2 Discography3 Television work4 Awards5 References6 External linksBiography[edit]Jensen was a native Hawaiian athletic song stylist whose "white hot soul" electrified audiences. He was of Hawaiian, French, Danish, English and Irish descent.[1]A graduate of Farrington High School, he first used the stage name Lance Curtis.  He was a main showroom caliber draw who filled rooms at the Outrigger Waikiki, the Oceania Floating Restaurant, Hilton Hawaiian Dome, Reef Towers Polynesian Palace and the Hula Hut.[2][3]By 1968, this one-time opening act for the Rolling Stones had become an international performer, signing with Don Costa Productions[4] and began performing at the El Quid in Mexico City.  He often divided his career between the islands and Las Vegas, Nevada. Jensen earned the sobriquet "The Giant" because of his tall stature, but he had a talent to match that nickname.  His vocal stylings came deep from his Hawaiian soul, as he danced around the stage.  Some have compared seeing his physicality on stage to watching the seemingly effortless glide of a  professional ice skater. In 1970, he was appearing at the Century Plaza in New York City,[5]  in his debut of that city.  In 1970,[6] 1971,[7] 1972[8]  and 1973,[9] he appeared at the Copacabana in New York,[10]  aptly being compared to James Brown, the superstar most analogous to Jensen's onstage style.He branched out into acting with guest starring roles on popular television shows. In 1982,[11] he appeared on The Mike Douglas Show when it was broadcast from Hawaii.In his later years, Jensen became a born again evangelical Christian minister.He died of Lou Gehrig's Disease, complicated by heart surgery and a series of mini-strokes, which took his legs before it took his life on June 21, 2006.[12]  Jensen is survived by his wife Toni, daughters Summer Jensen, Renee Jensen-Oliveira of Honolulu and Nikeila Jensen of Los Angeles, daughter Jennifer Garcia of Las Vegas, and son Brandon Jensen of Honolulu. He also has three grandchildren.[13]Discography[edit]White Hot Soul (1969) LP album 519361 (Probe)Real Good Woman / Bird You Must Fly (1970) promo single CP479 (Probe)Dick Jensen (1973) LP album KZ31794 (Philadelphia International)Dick Jensen (1973) LP album EPC65591 (Epic)Going Up The Mountain (1973) single EPC 1395 (Epic)Peace of Mind / New York City's A Lonely Town (1973) single ZS73542 (Epic)Television work[edit]The Islander (1978)Hawaii Five-OMagnum, P.I.

The movie starts with an incident that takes place in Bombay, where burglar John Honai breaks into a house to look for a briefcase. In the next scene, the four young men appear and use their wits to impress young neighbourhood girls. Maya, a girl from Kannur, and her grandparents relocate to Harihar Nagar, and happen to be Mahadevan's new neighbours. The four men try to win Maya over on many occasions. Mahadevan and Appukuttan fail to watch her bathing when her grandmother screams on suspicion of theft. She attempts to murder Govindan Kutty the next day, and Appukuttan's plan fails when Maya's grandfather is injured. They assault a bike owner and force him to blow air into it to get Maya's attention, but fail. One day, they bribe the postman to get hold of the letter she sent. They learn that Maya has come to Harihar Nagar to learn about the death of her brother, a boxer named Sethu Madhavan, which she thinks was a suicide.Maya visits the mother a friend of her brother's whose name is Andrew at his home . She asks Ammachi, Andrew's mother, to contact her if she gets any information about her brother. The four men approach Andrew's mother and pretend to be Sethu's friends. They manage to get Sethu's photograph by telling him they wanted it for the colony's sports club. Maya gets this information from Ammachi and meets the four young men. She believes them to be Sethu's friends after seeing his photo at their house. Thomas Kutty meets her at the boxing club, faking that he is a boxer after knocking down the other three men who now fear Maya's grandparents because they suspect them. Thomas Kutty almost tells her the truth about Mahadevan, Appukuttan and Govindan Kutty, and only did not name them them(calling them pickpockets and snatchers). They get angry. The four fabricate a story about how Sethu had an affair with a girl, and make her believe it by saying that the bike owner's henchmen who assault them are those of the parents of the girl, who opposed to the affair. They fight back the henchmen after letting Thomas Kutty get beaten up for a while because of his betrayal of them, and Maya believes them because they fake tears and sadness.Hearing that the four men are friends of Sethu, John Honai kidnaps them to retrieve the briefcase on the pretext that he would let them leave in ten minutes. Maya, in search of her brother's former lover, learns of Annie Philip, a friend of her brother's whom he knew from the library. Annie is now a nun in a convent, and has adopted the name Sister Josephine. Annie reveals her history with Sethu. She tells her that Andrew's father was a businessman who was murdered by John Honai's father, and had built a business empire with the money stolen from Andrew's father. Andrew sought to cause trouble in the business to take revenge. Honai's father sold all of his assets and tried to run away with the money in the briefcase, but was murdered by Andrew on the way. Later, Andrew is seen dead on a beach, and Sethu leaves to Andrew's house, keeping Ammachi ignorant of his death. He gives Annie the briefcase. After returning to Bombay, Sethu gives Honai a briefcase similar to the one given to Annie; when Honai opens it, he finds it is full of bricks. Furious, he murdered Sethu. However, Annie is ignorant of the innocence of the four men, and tells Maya that they are Honai's gangsters.The four young men who were kidnapped by Honai manage to escape, but are chased by him and his associates. Maya and her grandparents call the police because of the false information given by Annie about them. Maya and her grandparents are also kidnapped by Honai but the four young men rescue them. Ammachi finds out about Andrew's death from Annie, who gives her the briefcase. While Ammachi is cooking dinner, Honai comes to her house to get the briefcase. Ammachi removes a fuse and the lights go out. After trying to find Ammachi, Honai unknowingly lights a lighter near the lit gas stove and he quickly burns to death.In the end, Maya and her grandparents are returning to Kannur. Maya gives the four young men the briefcase, which they open, finding it full of riches.Cast[edit]Mukesh as MahadevanSiddique as Govindan KuttyJagadish as AppukuttanAshokan as Thomas KuttySuresh Gopi as SethumadhavanSai Kumar as AndrewsRizabawa as John HonaiGeetha Vijayan as MayaKaviyoor Ponnamma as Andrew's motherRekha as Sister Josephine / Annie PhillipPhilomina as Sethumadhava and Maya's grandmotherParavoor Bharathan as Sethumadhavan and Maya's grandfatherAppa Haja as CherianThrissur Elsy as Mahadevan's motherReception[edit]The film got positive reviews and was commercial success.[3][4]Soundtrack[edit]The soundtrack features two songs composed by S.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 226.[1] It lies midway between Lincoln and Newark, 2 miles (3.2 km) to the south-east of the A46.Norton Disney is the seat of the Disney family, an Anglicised version of the original French surname d'Isigny, of Isigny-sur-Mer, Normandy, from whom film producer Walt Disney's family might be descended.[2]The Village has one public house, The Green Man, which was formerly the St Vincent Arms.Contents1 History1.1 Walt Disney visit2 References3 External linksHistory[edit]There is a commemorative brass in the medieval church of St Michael commemorating three generations of the d’Isigny or Disney family, made about 1580. In the bottom panel is an inscription reading:The lyfe, conversacion and Service, of the first above named William Disney and of Richard Disney his sonne were comendable amongest ther Neighbours trewe and fathefull to ther Prince and cuntre & acceptable Thallmighty of whom the truth they are received to Salvation accordinge to the Stedfast faythe which they had in & throughe the mercy and merit of Christ our savior Thees thuthes are thus sett for the that in all ages God maybe thankfully Glorified for thes and suche lyke his gracius benifites.Two mosaic floors were found when excavating a Roman villa in the parish. The site was near to the Roman town of Brough or Crocoalana, on the Fosse Way, just over the border in Nottinghamshire.[citation needed]During the Second World War, RAF Station Swinderby (later renamed RAF Station Norton Disney) was home to No 93 Maintenance Unit (No 93 MU) from August 1939 until 1958.[citation needed]Walt Disney visit[edit]Walt Disney visited the village on the afternoon of Thursday 7 July 1949, in an attempt to trace his ancestry.[3]Walt Disney already been in the UK from 20 June 1949, arriving at Southampton on RMS Queen Elizabeth; he embarked on a six-day motoring holiday with his two teenage daughters, Diane and Sharon, and his wife, with a convoy of cars. After seeing the village, he left for a night at Boroughbridge in North Yorkshire, later visiting 8 Howard Place in Edinburgh on Friday 8 July.[4] He visited Loch Ness.[5] Disney also planned to visit the Derbyshire Peaks, Stratford-upon-Avon, the Scottish Highlands, and Burns country.[6][7]His film Treasure Island was being filmed at Denham Film Studios from 4 July 1949, being also filmed at Falmouth and Hartland Quay at Bideford, in Devon, from Monday 4 July 1949 on the Ryelands 158-ton schooner, owned by Plym Shipping Line, for 3 weeks. It was the first film that Disney had made abroad.References[edit]^ "Civil Parish population 2011". Neighbourhood Statistics. Office for National Statistics.

Alluding to the management-speak idiom "It's like herding cats" that refers to the impossibility of controlling the uncontrollable, it posits an analogy between herding cats and the solution of seemingly impossible problems by EDS.Using a "giant Western metaphor", it features "grizzled cowboys"[1] herding thousands of cats across the Montana prairie,[2] terminating in the satisfactory resolution "EDSolved".  The commercial was shown on 30 January 2000 at the Super Bowl XXXIV[3] and was cited by then-President Bill Clinton as his favorite commercial.[1]Contents1 Title and Cat Herders campaign2 Cast2.1 Actors/cowboys2.2 Cats3 Filming3.1 Location and conditions3.2 Script3.3 Cat training and filming3.4 Animal welfare4 Agency and creative credits5 Awards and accolades6 References7 External linksTitle and Cat Herders campaign[edit]EDS retained Fallon in 1999 to create a campaign with strong brand awareness with a dual purpose: to change the company's image for present and future growth and also to improve the morale and self-image of its employees.[3]    Fulfilling this remit, the advertisement "gave EDS employees an image that was serious, despite the humor of the commercial, and it highlighted EDS’s problem-solving capabilities for its customers."[3]The title "Cat Herders" applied to both the initial advertisement and the campaign, which was presented as a trilogy.[3]  The two sequels, "Airplane" and "Running with Squirrels", had visual impact but did not replicate the success of "Cat Herders".[3]Cast[edit]Authentic cowboys were required, and a casting call was put out across Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado and California.[2]  Some of the cast had never acted previously but others were SAG-accredited.[2]Actor Tony Becker points out that many of the actors were "real-life cowboys",[4] and gives a comprehensive cast list:Actors/cowboys[edit]Steven LaneTony Becker[4]Mark Brooks[5][6]Tim Carroll[7]David ClevelandJeremy Cluff[8]Walter DoranJake SandersKent Wakefield Smith[9]Susan SmithGene McLaughlin[10][11][12][13]Clif Stokes[14][15]David Jean Thomas[16]R. J. Chambers - Stunts[17]Brian Burrows -Stunts[18]Notwithstanding the listing of only two participants as stunt performers, many of the actors are skilled cowboy professionals, with credits as horse trainers, wranglers, doubles, trick-roper and also as stunt performers.   A few operate ranches or rodeo or stunt performing services, as per the citations given above.For the shoot, some actors wore their own clothes, but their faces were made up to look cat-scratched, tanned or weatherbeaten.[2]Cats[edit]Numbers of cats used to create the illusion of thousands running wild vary from 50[2] to 60.[4]  According to Becker, "only about 60 cats were used in the actual filming (with about 1 trainer per 5 cats).  The rest were computer-generated".[4]Filming[edit]Location and conditions[edit]Cat Herders was filmed during December 1999 at Tejon Ranch, about 70 miles north of Los Angeles.[2]  Established in 1843,[19] it is, at nearly 270,000 acres, the largest continuous expanse of private land in California.[20]   The landscape features a "dramatic tapestry of rugged mountains, steep canyons, oak-covered rolling hills, and broad valleys"[19] and cowboys on horseback still herd cattle along the open grazing land.[19]Filming was accomplished over five days of wintry conditions, workers in goggles and full face masks battling through rain, snow, fog, sleet, blowing sand and fierce 40mph winds.[2]  As one worker recalls:  "Shooting this spot was the most cold and miserable shooting days I've ever had.  Out in the plains, freezing cold, wind so strong it would catch your car door and bend it back."[21]   On set, the cats were housed in individual cages in "trucks filled with movie cats".[21]  At night, "interspecies bonding" occurred with crew members bringing cats back to their hotels:[2]"we actually snuck a cat into our motel room because he had had surgery and needed to recuperate.  So he lived under the bed".[21]Script[edit]The copywriter was Greg Hahn,[22] but "the script came largely out of the improvised quips of the cowboys, replacing cattle with cats".[23]Cat training and filming[edit]The commercial called for differing feline skills, including running, water scenes, or staying motionless.[2] To prepare for filming, 50 cats and their trainers travelled to Tejon Ranch a week before the crew.[2]For the dramatic river-crossing, Art Director Dean Hanson told Adweek, Trainers taught the cats to swim by starting them out in one-quarter inch of water, then gradually building the pool to swimming depth. . . . Since we were shooting in nippy weather, our 'river' was actually a small pool warmed by a portable heater, like a little cat Jacuzzi.[2]Cats worked in shifts to film the herding scenes, with head trainer Karin McElhatton hiding in tumbleweeds to issue verbal directions.[2]The illusion of cats stampeding was achieved by using clickers normally associated with food.  During filming, clickers prompted the felines to run downhill, towards food which was out of shot.[21]  At other times, cats were lured by "strategically smeared tuna".[2]Animal welfare[edit]Monitored by the American Humane Association, horses and cats were filmed separately in order to prevent "accidental tramplings".[2]For scenes where both are required, a computer-operated motion-control camera is used to film the same shot over and over with each animal. The horses, background and layers of kitties are filmed separately, and each will be stripped in during post-production to create the illusion of an elaborate cat drive.[2]Agency and creative credits[edit]For the Fallon agency, Minneapolis, David Lubars (Creative Director), Dean Hanson (Art Director), Greg Hahn (Copywriter), Judy Brink (Executive Producer) and Marty Wetherall (Agency Producer).Agency Producer and Agency Visual Effects Supervisor: Bob WendtThe film company was Hungry Man.
